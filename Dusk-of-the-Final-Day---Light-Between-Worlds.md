Ellara’s heart raced as she hurried along the narrow path, mist swirling around the rocky outcroppings. She'd slipped away during preparations for evening prayers, her whispered lie to Brother Sorin about the herb garden weighing heavy in her stomach. But tonight, of all nights, she couldn't bear the thought of missing this meeting.

The familiar path felt different today... each stone, each bend, each patch of stubborn highland heather seemed to demand her attention, as if insisting she commit them all to memory. The gnarled rowan trees that clung tenaciously to the hillside had witnessed countless seasons, their resilient forms bearing testament to the harsh highland winds that had shaped them just as surely as they had shaped the people of Arkos. Soon these would exist only in her recollections, stored away like precious keepsakes. Her fingers instinctively touched the small sunstone talisman in her pocket, its smooth surface worn from years of similar worried touches.

The evening air carried the scent of wild thyme and damp earth, stirred by the sharp, cool breeze that always swept down from the higher peaks at dusk. The distinctive fragrance of bog myrtle reached her as she passed a marshy hollow, its sweet, resinous smell a comfort she'd never find in the Capital. It would be different there, she'd been told. Warmer. The air heavy with the press of too many people and too many buildings. No highland winds to clear one’s thoughts, no blankets of heather stretching to the horizon, no mountain burns rushing clear and cold over ancient stone.

As she rounded the bend toward the Grey Sisters, three tall, slender stones that caught the wind with eerie whistling sounds, she saw Lyra already there, gathering the wildflowers that thrived in the rocky soil. Fading sunlight broke through the clouds, casting the quarry stone in amber light that seemed to pulse with its own gentle rhythm. Behind Lyra, the valley spread out below, with Arkos nestled in its heart, small wisps of smoke rising from evening cookfires, and beyond it, the dark mouth of the Sunstone Quarry. Ellara refused to look at the road where her journey would begin tomorrow.

For a moment, Ellara simply watched her friend. Lyra's movements were deliberate yet graceful as she selected blooms, her dark hair falling loose around her shoulders. She wore the practical clothes of a highlander, sturdy wool and leather, built for highland weather, but there was nothing practical about the way she arranged the flowers, with a reverence and care that spoke of the old ways Ellara had been taught to mistrust.

When Lyra finally noticed her, they shared a moment of silent recognition before rushing into each other's arms. The embrace felt like coming home, the way Ellara imagined home should feel, warm and safe, unlike the Priory's austere chambers and rigid discipline. It was not devoid of love and care, but she often wondered what a normal home felt like. Perhaps it felt like this.

"I was worried you wouldn't come," Lyra whispered, her voice catching. Her arms tightened around Ellara as if she could physically prevent her departure.

"I told you I would." Ellara pulled back, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "We agreed to meet here one last time before I left." The words hung heavy between them. They'd spent the past week discussing her departure, each conversation more strained than the last, both of them maintaining the fiction that this was just a temporary separation, a brief journey for study. The pretense had worn thin, like mist before a strong wind.

"You leave at first light," Lyra said, not a question but a statement. Her eyes, the deep velvet moss that lined so many of the nearby rocks, searched Ellara's face. "We said we wouldn't spend our last evening together pretending."

Ellara nodded, grateful to finally drop the charade. "Yes. Abbot Aris has arranged everything." She looked out over the valley, toward the quarry that had provided the stone for the Priory where she'd spent nearly all her life. "The quarrymaster is providing a cart to take me to the river, then by boat to the Capital."

Lyra's expression hardened slightly as she reached for Ellara's hands, her grip surprisingly firm. Her palms were rougher than Ellara's, marked by small scars from years of gathering herbs from the rocky hillsides and exploring the rugged terrain around Arkos, hands that knew the land Ellara was leaving. "And we're still pretending it's just for study?" Lyra’s voice was low, fierce. "After all these years of sharing everything, Ellara, _everything_... we're ending our time together with a lie?"

The accusation struck Ellara more sharply than the highland wind. Lyra deserved the truth, raw and painful as it might be. Ellara squeezed Lyra's hands, looking down at their intertwined fingers, hands bound by years of secrets whispered under the stars.

"No," Ellara whispered, the single word tasting like ash. She forced herself to meet Lyra's intense, searching gaze. "You're right. It's not just study. It's..." She faltered, the full weight of it settling upon her. "It's because she's afraid, Lyra. Abbot Aris is afraid _of me_."

A shiver ran through Ellara, cold and deep, unrelated to the evening chill. The Abbot's face swam in her mind, stern and unyielding, but now Ellara clearly saw the fear behind those piercing eyes, the fear that had dictated this departure. She recalled pity there too, mingling with the fear.

"She fears the Divine Spark," Ellara continued, the term they used in secret feeling both sacred and dangerous on her tongue. "She doesn't understand the warmth, the whispers, or the light. She believes it isn't Eulogia's grace but something older, something... Shadowed." Ellara swallowed hard, the next words the most difficult. "She thinks it's dangerous. That _I_ am dangerous. Being here, in the highlands, near the stones... near _you_... she thinks it feeds it, makes it stronger." Her voice cracked. "The Capital isn't for guidance, Lyra. It's to... contain me. To correct what she sees as wrong. She's sending me away because she fears what I am, what I might become if I stay." The unspoken finality hung between them: _And she may never let me return._

They had discussed the Divine Spark many times over the years, Ellara describing the warmth that would rise within her during prayers, the way plants seemed to reach toward her in the garden, the whispers she sometimes heard when near the standing stones that no one else acknowledged. Lyra had never shown fear at these revelations, only fascination and a kind of reverent awe.

"But it's beautiful," Lyra insisted, her dark eyes flashing with conviction. "I was there when it first happened, with my mother. What flowed through you then wasn't false, it wasn't dangerous."

The memory hung between them... Lyra's mother dying despite Morwen's remedies, and Ellara, just a child, suddenly suffused with light as she held the woman's hand. It hadn't saved her, but something had passed between them, something that had both frightened and fascinated the girls ever since.

"I remember her smile," Ellara said softly. "At the end, when the light came. She wasn't afraid of it."

"No," Lyra agreed. "She recognized it. She'd always spoken of the light our ancestors followed before the Eulogians came with their sunstone and their scripture. I know that's what she saw that day."

The wind picked up, sending a mournful whistle through the Grey Sisters. It had been nearly twelve years since that night, yet the memory remained crystal clear... the small cottage filled with the scent of Morwen's herbs, the labored breathing, Ellara holding Lyra as they both cried, and then that moment of unexpected connection, of light flowing between worlds.

Above them, a red kite soared on the evening thermals, its forked tail distinctive against the darkening sky. Such birds were common in the highlands, their haunting calls part of the tapestry of sounds that defined Arkos. Ellara wondered if there would be red kites in the Capital or if she would hear only the cries of river gulls and the constant clamor of people and metal.

"Remember when Brother Sorin caught us here?" Lyra said suddenly, her smile tinged with sadness but genuine. "We were fourteen, I think. He was gathering lumenberries and found us dancing around the Ancestor's Perch."

Ellara laughed despite herself, the sound carrying across the hillside. "He made us scrub the Refectory floor for a week, but he never told the Abbot. He just said that some places deserve respect regardless of what faith claims them."

"He understood more than he let on," Lyra murmured. "He's been protecting you in his own way. Remember how he would always find tasks for you in the herb garden, away from Abbot Aris's scrutiny? How he taught you about plants that weren't strictly part of Eulogian medicine?"

Ellara nodded slowly, recalling the quiet afternoons in the Priory garden, Brother Sorin's gentle voice explaining the properties of plants the Abbot would have dismissed as too closely tied to folk remedies and the old ways. "He gave me seeds to plant near the eastern wall, where they'd get the most sun. Heather and moon thistle, plants that aren't traditionally part of Priory gardens."

"Plants that strengthen the connection to the Divine Spark, according to my grandmother's teachings," Lyra added. She reached up to tuck a strand of dark hair behind her ear, a gesture so familiar that Ellara felt her heart constrict with preemptive loss. "He was born in the highlands. I think he understands that faith here is... different from the Capital's rigid doctrines."

A comfortable silence fell between them as the last light began to fade from the valley. In the distance, the first lamps were being lit in Arkos, small pinpricks of warmth against the gathering darkness. The sunstone in the Priory walls would be beginning its soft nighttime glow, barely perceptible except in the deepest night.

The air grew sharper with cold as darkness descended, the way it always did here, even in summer. The stars emerged above them, brilliant and clear in a way she would soon keenly miss once they were hidden behind the smoke and haze of the Capital. Ellara tried to memorize their patterns, knowing that even if she saw the same constellations from the Capital, they would never look quite the same as they did from this hillside.

Lyra reached into her pocket and withdrew a small leather pouch, its surface decorated with carefully stitched patterns that Ellara recognized as similar to the carvings on some of the older standing stones scattered throughout the highlands. From it, she arranged small stones in a circle on the flat rock between them, river stones worn smooth by highland burns then added sprigs of heather and thyme and a few dried lumenberries from last season's gathering.

"Lyra, I shouldn't..." Ellara began, her Priory training asserting itself even now.

"Just sit with me," Lyra said softly. "Nothing more. No invocations, no rituals. Just us, as we've always been."

As they settled within the circle, the wind died down, and the scent of crushed thyme and heather rose around them. Ellara closed her eyes, feeling the familiar warmth building in her chest, the same sensation the Abbot had warned her against. But here, with Lyra, it felt right, necessary, even. It reminded her of summer days spent wading in cold burns, of watching golden eagles soar over the peaks beyond the quarry, of the taste of bilberries gathered from secret spots only the two of them knew.

"I've been thinking about that day a lot," Lyra said quietly. "With my mother. I think she gave you something, or awakened something that was already there. Something the Priory doesn't understand."

Ellara opened her eyes to find Lyra watching her intently. "The Abbot says my connection to the divine is... unusual. That it needs shaping, directing."

"Or controlling," Lyra said with a hint of bitterness. "The Eulogians have always feared what they can't explain. My grandmother told me stories about when they first came to the highlands, how they tried to destroy the standing stones but couldn't. How they built the Priory on the highest ridge to overshadow the old sacred places."

She gestured toward a distant peak where ancient stones stood silhouetted against the night sky. "We highlanders have always known there are spaces between worlds, places where the veil is thin. The standing stones mark those places. That's why the Eulogians couldn't destroy them—they're anchored in something deeper than stone."

A gentle light began to pulse between their still-joined hands, neither golden like sunstone nor white like orthodox descriptions of divine radiance, but something wilder, more ancient. It reminded Ellara of the rare, blue-green glow sometimes seen by bogs on the darkest nights, what the locals called "spirit lights." She wasn't sure which of them had initiated it, or if it had simply emerged from the space between them, born of years of shared secrets and sorrows.

"It doesn't feel wrong," Ellara whispered, watching the light dance across Lyra's features, highlighting the determination in her eyes. "It feels like... like finally being able to breathe after holding my breath for too long. Like the highland air after a storm."

"It's not wrong," Lyra agreed. "It's just different from what they've taught you. There have always been those who could touch the space between worlds; the Priory calls them heretics, but my grandmother called them blessed."

The light pulsed stronger, casting long shadows from the standing stones across the hillside. It illuminated the small circle Lyra had created, river stones arranged in a pattern that seemed oddly familiar to Ellara, though she'd never seen it before, and sprigs of herbs that Brother Sorin would never have approved for Priory use.

In the distance, an owl called, three haunting notes that echoed across the valley. The highlands were coming alive with night sounds: the rustling of foxes in the heather, the occasional bleat of a sheep from a pasture, the constant, gentle murmur of burns rushing toward the valley floor.

"Will you ever come back?" Lyra asked, her face illuminated by their shared light.

The question hung in the air between them. Ellara thought of the Priory, the only home she had ever known, with its rigid schedules marked by bell tolls, its cold stone corridors, Brother Sorin's kindly guidance, and Abbot Aris's stern but well-meant concern. She thought of the Capital, with its grand cathedral and ancient libraries, its crowds and noise and anonymity she'd only heard about. And she thought of these highlands, the craggy peaks that had defined her horizon since birth, the clear burns that fed the valley below, the standing stones with their ancient mysteries.

"I don't know," Ellara admitted. "The Priory is my home, but after the Capital..." She couldn't finish the thought. Would they even want her back? Would she still be the same Ellara who had grown up within those walls, who had gathered lumenberries with Brother Sorin and learned the names of highland birds from Lyra? Or would the Capital reshape her into someone who no longer belonged to the austere beauty of these hills?

"Then we'll find each other in the light between worlds," Lyra said, echoing a phrase from their childhood imaginings—a place neither here nor there, where the Eulogian faith and the old ways might coexist. A secret space they had talked about after Lyra's mother died, a connection that transcended physical presence. It was a phrase neither of them could remember inventing, yet it had been branded in both their souls.

"How?" Ellara asked, suddenly desperate to believe it could be true. "The Capital is so far from the highlands, from these stones, from everything I've ever known."

Lyra smiled, the light between their hands reflecting in her eyes. "The standing stones aren't the only places where the veil is thin. My grandmother said the Divine Spark exists everywhere, it's just harder to hear in some places than others." She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a whisper though there was no one to overhear them on the empty hillside. "When you pray, when you feel that warmth inside you that they're so afraid of, think of me. I'll do the same. We'll meet there, in that light."

The distant toll of the Priory bell made Ellara start. The sound carried clearly across the cooling air: the first call to Vespers, the evening prayers. She would be missed soon, and on the night before her departure, she couldn't risk the Abbot's displeasure.

"I have to go..." She began to rise, reluctantly breaking the circle.

Lyra reached for something at her wrist. "Wait, I made you..."

But voices called from the path below, novices sent to find her, no doubt. Ellara stood quickly, scattering the arranged stones.

"They can't find you here," she said urgently. "It would only confirm the Abbot's fears."

Lyra nodded, understanding immediately. She gathered her pouch of herbs and stones with practiced efficiency. "Tomorrow before dawn," she said. "I'll come to the Priory gate, before you leave for the Capital."

Ellara nodded, though something told her such a meeting would never happen. The Abbot had arranged for her to depart with the first light, accompanied by a solemn escort who would brook no delays. "May the light guide you," she said, the formal Eulogian farewell feeling hollow and insufficient for what might be their final parting.

"This isn't our last meeting," Lyra insisted, her voice fierce with conviction. She pressed something into Ellara's palm, a single blue mountain flower, its petals still wet with mist. It was a highland bluebell, rare and precious, growing only in the highest meadows. "Remember the light between worlds. Remember me."

Their fingers lingered together for a moment longer, and Ellara felt a surge of that strange warmth pass between them, stronger than ever before. Then she turned and ran, picking her way carefully down the rocky path toward the Priory, the voices of the searching novices growing louder.

She found them at the base of the hill, two young girls in white initiate robes, their figures dwarfed by the rugged terrain. "Sister Ellara!" the taller one called, relief evident in her voice. "Abbot Aris has been asking for you. It's almost time for Vespers."

"I was gathering herbs for Brother Sorin," Ellara said, the lie coming more easily now. She gestured vaguely toward a patch of wild thyme growing along the path. "For the journey tomorrow."

The younger novice looked at her with wide, solemn eyes. "Are you afraid to go to the Capital, Sister?"

Ellara considered the question as they began walking back toward the Priory, its sunstone walls gleaming faintly in the gathering dusk. "Not afraid," she said finally. "But I will miss Arkos. This is the only home I've known." She glanced back toward the Grey Sisters, now barely visible in the deepening twilight.

"The Capital is very grand, they say," the taller girl offered. "Buildings taller than the quarry cliffs, and more people than stones in the river."

"They say there are no standing stones there, Sister. No wild places like ours," the younger one added with a hint of awe. "Just streets and squares and bridges."

Ellara clutched the mountain flower in her hand, careful to keep it hidden in the folds of her robe. "Yes," she said softly. "Very different from our highlands."

The rest of the evening passed in a blur. Prayers in the Chapel, where she avoided Abbot Aris's searching gaze. The evening meal in the Refectory, where conversations were hushed and formal. Final instructions for her journey from Brother Sorin, his kind eyes conveying more than his measured words could say.

"The Capital may surprise you," he told her. "It's not all stone and doctrine. There are gardens there too, and people who understand that faith can take many forms." His gaze met hers briefly, and she wondered how much he truly knew about her connection to the Divine Spark, about her friendship with Lyra, about their visits to the standing stones.

"Thank you, Brother Sorin," she said. "For everything you've taught me."

His smile was sad but genuine. "The highlands have their own wisdom, their own way of touching the divine. Don't forget that, even in the grandeur of the Capital."

Later, after the final prayers and the great silence had descended upon the Priory, Ellara stood at her narrow window, looking out toward the highlands where a small light flickered near the standing stones. Lyra, perhaps, still keeping vigil. Or merely a trick of moonlight on mist. She touched the flower, now carefully pressed between pages of her personal prayer book, and felt that strange warmth rise in her chest again.

Outside her window, the night was alive with sound and scent, the distant cry of a fox, the whisper of wind through heather, the sharp, clean smell of peat and stone that meant home. The stars wheeled overhead, brighter and clearer than they ever would appear from the Capital's lamplit streets. Would she remember these constellations as viewed from the highlands, after years away? Would she forget the feeling of this thin, crisp air in her lungs?

As she prepared for sleep, folding her few belongings for the journey ahead, she discovered a small package tucked beneath her pillow, a handwoven bracelet made of local fibers dyed with mineral pigments from the quarry. The colors were those of the highlands in autumn: deep purple heather, russet bracken, the golden-brown of deer fur. With it was a scrap of parchment in Lyra's flowing script: _"Find me in the light between worlds."_

Ellara ran her fingers over the bracelet, wondering how Lyra had managed to leave it here, in the heart of the Priory. She slipped it beneath her mattress, too dangerous to wear openly, too precious to leave behind.

She fell asleep with her hand pressed against the hidden treasure, and dreamed of standing stones and ancient light, of spaces between worlds where no divisions existed, where the Eulogian faith and the old ways flowed together like highland burns joining to form a mighty river.

The journey to the Capital began before dawn, just as she had known it would. There was no opportunity to meet Lyra at the gate; Abbot Aris herself escorted Ellara to the waiting cart, along with Brother Sorin, who pressed a small package of dried herbs into her hands with whispered instructions for their use.

"For homesickness," he said softly. "The scent of highland herbs can be a comfort in strange places."

As the cart pulled away from the only home she had ever known, Ellara looked back once. The Priory stood solemn and stark against the lightening sky, its sunstone walls catching the first rays of dawn. Beyond it, on the highland ridge, she thought she saw a solitary figure standing among the ancient stones, arm raised in farewell.

She couldn't return the gesture, not with Abbot Aris watching, but she touched the hidden flower in her prayer book and whispered words that were not from any Eulogian teaching: "The light between worlds."

The cart rumbled down the stony track toward the valley below, past familiar landmarks that now seemed suddenly precious: the gnarled rowan tree where she and Lyra had picnicked on sunny days, the small burn crossing the path where they had once caught tiny, darting fish in cupped hands, the outcropping shaped like a sleeping dog that marked the halfway point to town. The light changed as they descended, the golden highland morning giving way to the blue-tinted mist that often filled the valley at dawn.

Arkos emerged from the haze as they approached, stone cottages with peat smoke rising from their chimneys, the blacksmith already at work, the quarry silent but waiting for the day's labor to begin. People stopped to watch the cart pass, a few raising hands in farewell. Ellara wondered if they knew why she was leaving, if they shared the Abbot's fears or Lyra's understanding.

The journey continued past the village, toward the river where a boat waited to carry her away from the highlands, from everything familiar, from Lyra. As the rugged hills receded behind her, Ellara felt the warmth in her chest dim, as though distance from the standing stones—or from Lyra—already threatened her connection to the Divine Spark.

---

Months later, she would wake in her small, austere room in the Capital, reaching instinctively for the handwoven bracelet Lyra had left for her that last night in Arkos. In the predawn darkness, far from home, Ellara would touch the dried blue flower hidden and sometimes, in that moment between sleeping and waking, she would feel a familiar warmth bloom in her chest, and see a light that was neither sunstone nor candle flame but something wilder, more ancient. In that light, she would catch glimpses of a stone circle on a misty highland, a figure gathering wildflowers with dark hair loose around her shoulders, and smell the distinctive scents of heather, thyme, and peat smoke that meant home. It was a simple, profound presence, a feeling that echoed Lyra's soft plea on their last night, a yearning whisper across the miles: _Nothing more. No invocations, no rituals. Just us, as we've always been._

"The light between worlds," she would whisper each night before sleep claimed her. And somewhere in the distant highlands, she knew, Lyra would be whispering the same.
