- Raised with Eulogian teachings that label the old ways as dangerous superstition, particularly regarding the [[Highland Standing Stones]] and ancestral rituals (though she is curious about them especially wher [[Lyra Meadowlight]] talks about them)
- Taught to view [[Morwen Stonehand|folk healers]] like Morwen with suspicion, considering their practices borderline heretical.
- Personal spiritual experiences now create significant cognitive dissonance - her manifestations don't align with orthodox Eulogian teachings but feel genuinely divine.
- Increasingly sympathetic to marginalized beliefs after experiencing her own otherness in the Capital, though still maintains outward orthodoxy.
- Still deeply uncomfortable with overtly magical practices.
- Initially carries ingrained prejudices against [[Fey]], mythical beings, and Heretical Magics based on upbringing and teachings.
