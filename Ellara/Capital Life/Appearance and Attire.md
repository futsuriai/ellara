# Appearance and Attire

Ellara's appearance blends her highland heritage with her adaptation to Capital expectations:

## Physical Appearance

- **Age** - Early 20s.
- **Build** - Slender with the wiry strength developed from highland living and Priory labor. Used to long hikes.
- **Complexion** - Fair skin that shows traces of past sun exposure from outdoor work in Arkos.
- **Hair** - [[TBD]] hair typically worn in a simple style that keeps it off her face, either braided or pinned back. While Capital clerics often wear elaborate styles signifying rank, she maintains the simpler approach common in Arkos.
- **Eyes** - Clear, earnest grey eyes that tend to maintain direct eye contact slightly longer than is comfortable in Capital society, a highland trait that some find either disarming or disconcerting.

## Clerical Attire

- **Daily Wear** - Standard Eulogian clerical robes in muted [[TBD]] colors with [[TBD]] indicating her intermediate rank. While maintaining all required elements, her robes are slightly simpler in cut than typical Capital styles.  
- **Ceremonial Dress** - Proper formal vestments for important ceremonies, though she struggles with the multiple layers and complex fastenings unfamiliar from highland practice.
- **Highland Elements** - Subtly incorporates small highland touches that remain within regulation: a hand-embroidered belt with traditional patterns, specific knot-work in her cincture, and a small [[Sunstone|sunstone]] clasp holding her formal mantle.

## Personal Touches

- **Sunstone Jewelry** - Always wears a small, polished sunstone on a simple silver chain beneath her robes, touching it for reassurance in stressful situations.
- **Herbal Sachets** - Carries small sachets of highland herbs sewn into hidden pockets in her garments, both for their familiar scent and subtle spiritual protection.
- **Practical Adaptations** - Modified her standard-issue footwear with sturdier soles better suited for walking, reflecting the highland preference for practical durability over Capital fashion.

## Evolution Since Arrival

- **Initial Awkwardness** - Upon first arrival, was notably uncomfortable in Capital attire, with visible adjustments and fidgeting during formal occasions.
- **Growing Adaptation** - Has gradually learned to move more naturally in formal vestments while maintaining touches of highland identity.  
- **Situational Awareness** - Has developed a keen sense of when strict adherence to Capital fashion norms is necessary to blend it.

## How Others Perceive Her

- Conservative Capital clergy often view her slightly modified attire as provincial and unsophisticated
- Those familiar with highland traditions might recognize the meaning behind certain patterns or arrangements
- The general public would simply see her as a somewhat unusual but clearly identifiable Eulogian cleric
