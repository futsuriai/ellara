# Daily Rituals

Ellara maintains traditions that blend formal [[Eulogia Church|Eulogian]] observances with some Highland traditions.

## Morning Rituals (Dawn)

- **First Light Prayer** - Rises before dawn to greet the first light, a highland tradition less common in the Capital. Uses her [[Keepsakes|sunstone talisman]] to catch the first rays when possible.

- **Meditation Circle** - When in deep spiritual doubt or has a big decision in front of her creates a small circle using her river stone and herbs. Sits in silent communion with for exactly 17 minutes (a number significant in highland Eulogian practice). It reminds her of [[Lyra Meadowlight]] who taught her about it.

- **Scripture Reading** - Loves the availability of treatises and deeper dives into theological arguments she wasn't able to get in [[Arkos]].

## Daytime Observances

- **Midday Blessing** - Pauses all activities at the height of the sun to recite the Blessing of Illumination, often finding a secluded spot with direct sunlight.

- **Herb Preparation** - Spends time daily working with herbs and plants, seeing this as both practical service and spiritual connection.

- **Observational Walking** - Takes measured walks through gardens or courtyards, stopping at seven specific points to offer silent prayers. This practice puzzles Capital clergy who prefer stationary prayer. This is her way of honoring the much longer spiritual hikes she used to do back home.

## Evening Practices (Dusk)

- **Candlelight Reflection** - Lights a single candle at dusk and reviews her day through the lens of Eulogian teachings, noting moments of connection and discord with the Spirit.

- **Correspondence Ritual** - Reads or writes letters from [[Correspondence|home]] as a as a way to ground herself.

- **Highland Hymns** - Sings traditional highland hymns softly in her quarters, sometimes harmonizing in ways that subtly invoke her connection to the Spirit.

## Weekly Observances

- **Day of Silence** - Observes one day each week (not the official church rest day) in partial silence, speaking only when necessary as that was a tradition in the Priory.
