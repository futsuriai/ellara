# Dietary Preferences

Ellara's relationship with food reflects both her highland upbringing and her adjustment to Capital cuisine:

## Highland Food Memories

- **Hearty Staples** - Misses the dense, dark bread made with highland grains that was a daily staple at the Priory. Capital bread seems overly refined and lacking substance to her.

- **Preserved Foods** - Grew up with smoked meats, pickled vegetables, and dried fruits as winter staples. Finds the constant availability of fresh produce in the Capital somewhat disconcerting and almost decadent.

- **Highland Stew** - Particularly longs for the thick, hearty vegetable and barley stew served at the Priory on holy days, seasoned with local herbs and served with fresh cheese.

## Capital Adjustments

- **Unfamiliar Abundance** - Still sometimes overwhelmed by the variety of foods available in the Capital, especially exotic fruits and imported spices that never reached Arkos.

- **Texture Preferences** - Gets overly excited about elaborate Capital cuisine with complex sauces and multiple flavors as much as she loves and grew up with simpler, more substantial fare. They make her feel like she's a princess almost.

## Current Eating Habits

- **Simple Selections** - When given choices, gravitates toward the plainest options available, out of a desire not to be seen as decadent. If fancier food is forced on her or she can get it without seeming to pick it though, she'll jump at the chance.

- **Fasting Practices** - Maintains highland fasting traditions, occasionally creating awkward situations when she declines certain foods.

- **Comfort Foods** - Has found a small bakery near the temple district that makes bread similar to Priory loaves, visiting weekly as a small comfort ritual.

## Social Dining

- **Meal Blessings** - Still instinctively uses highland blessing gestures over food, which she tries to disguise as adjusting her napkin when in formal company.

- **Communal Aspect** - Misses the Priory tradition of shared platters and conversation during meals, finding the sometimes silent, formal Capital dining alienating.

- **Herbal Teas** - Has become known for her knowledge of highland herbal tea blends, occasionally preparing these for select colleagues who appreciate their unique properties.

## Special Indulgences

- **Sunberry Preserves** - A highland specialty impossible to find in the Capital. [[Correspondence|Lyra occasionally sends small jars]] hidden among other items, which Ellara saves for moments of extreme homesickness.

- **Festival Cakes** - Still attempts to recreate traditional highland solstice cakes in her small quarters, though the available ingredients never quite capture the proper flavor (she's also not the best baker). 

- **Mead** - While the Priory allowed diluted mead on special occasions, Ellara finds the stronger wines preferred in Capital circles challenging and typically waters hers down significantly.
