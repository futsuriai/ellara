# Living Arrangements

Ellara's living situation in the [[../../Empire/Capital/Capital|Capital]] reflects her intermediate status within the [[../../Eulogia/Eulogia Church|church hierarchy]]:

## Quarters

- **Location** - A small private room in the eastern dormitory wing of the main Eulogian Complex, assigned to clergy of middling rank. The room is on the third floor with a small window facing the inner courtyard garden.

- **Size and Features** - Approximately 10 by 12 feet with a narrow bed, small writing desk, prayer kneeler, clothing chest, and a single shelf for personal items. The room has a simple oil lamp and modest fireplace that provides minimal heat in winter.

- **Personal Touches** - Ellara has carefully arranged her [[../Hometown Connections/Keepsakes|keepsakes]] on her shelf in a manner resembling a small shrine. She keeps dried herbs hanging near the window, ostensibly for their scent but also as part of her private rituals.

## Surrounding Environment

- **Neighbors** - Shares the dormitory wing primarily with other provincial clergy transferred to the Capital. Her immediate neighbors include an elderly priest from the western coast and a scholarly nun who rarely emerges from her room.

- **Commons** - Has access to shared bathing facilities at the end of the corridor and takes meals in the general refectory with other mid-ranking clergy. The refectory follows strict seating protocols that subtly reinforce church hierarchy.

- **Gardens** - Has permission to use the inner courtyard garden during daylight hours. Has discovered a secluded corner behind an ornamental shrine where she sometimes conducts more private devotions.
