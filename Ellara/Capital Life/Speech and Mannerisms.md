# Speech and Mannerisms

Ellara's way of speaking and moving distinctly marks her as a highland transplant in the Capital:

## Vocal Characteristics

- **Accent** - A soft highland lilt that becomes more pronounced when emotional or tired. Elongates certain vowel sounds and places emphasis on different syllables than Capital speakers. (For RP reasons I will NOT be attempting this most of the time)

- **Volume** - Naturally quieter than most Capital speakers, requiring others to lean in slightly to hear her in crowded settings. This stems from the Priory's emphasis on measured, thoughtful speech.

## Language Patterns

- **Religious Terminology** - Uses highland variants of common Eulogian terms that sometimes confuse Capital clergy. For example, says "[[TBD]]" instead of the Capital's formal "[[TBD]]" or Unlit vs Shadowed though she's very embarrassed when it happens as she wants to fit in.

- **Formal Address** - Struggles with the elaborate honorifics required for different ranks within Capital church hierarchy, sometimes defaulting to the simpler "Brother" or "Sister" used universally in Arkos.

- **Word choices** - Uses some slang that's not common in [[Bastion City]] especially in highly emotional situations.

## Non-verbal Communication

- **Posture** - Maintains the straight-backed, head slightly bowed posture ingrained from Priory training, which looks somewhat rigid and formal compared to the more relaxed bearing of Capital-raised clergy.

- **Eye Contact** - Makes direct, sustained eye contact during conversation in the highland tradition of honesty and directness, which can make Capital natives uncomfortable as they're accustomed to more nuanced gaze patterns indicating deference to rank.

## Adaptation Strategies

- **Code Switching** - Has developed the ability to shift between her natural highland speech and a more Capital-acceptable pattern in formal situations, though the effort is noticeable. She's attempting to mimic the Capital accent as much as possible.

- **Self-Correction** - Sometimes stops mid-sentence to rephrase using Capital terminology, particularly when addressing superiors.

## Emotional Indicators

- **Accent Intensification** - Her highland accent becomes significantly stronger when:
  - Defending highland theological interpretations
  - Speaking with others from provincial regions
  - Under extreme stress or emotion

- **Retreat to Silence** - When overwhelmed by Capital social complexity, often falls into the contemplative silence practiced in the Priory, which can be misinterpreted as sullenness or displeasure.
