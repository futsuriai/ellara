# Divine Reflavorings for Ellara

## Kalashtar Traits Replacement: The Divine Spark

- **Divine Enlightenment** (Dual Mind): Ellara's connection to the Divine Light grants her unusual clarity of thought and spiritual awareness, allowing her to resist attempts to sway her mind. (Advantage on Wisdom saving throws)

- **Light's Protection** (Mental Discipline): The Divine Spark within Ellara creates a shield against malevolent spiritual influences, deflecting energies that would harm her mind. (Resistance to psychic damage)

- **Sacred Connection** (Mind Link): Through whispered prayers and focused meditation, Ellara can share thoughts directly with others. This is a manifestation of her [[Spirit]] abilities. She is very hesitant to use this with people as she thinks it's of Heretical Magic after she saw how [[Abbot Aris]] reacted when she told her. (Telepathic communication ability)

- **Vigilant Spirit** (Severed from Dreams): While Ellara sleeps, her Divine Spark remains partially awake, communing with the ancient highland traditions and the Light. This connection shields her from supernatural influences that would manipulate her dreams, though she can still be put to sleep by magical means. (Immune to dream-affecting magic). 

- **Liturgical Prayers** (Quori Language): Besides knowing the old Highland Dialect Ellara has studied the liturgical language more than most. [[Abbot Aris]] taught her from primary sources and forced her to be able to think in it if needed. She can read very old books without a struggle if they are in the liturgical language.

## Core Druid Abilities Replacement: Highland Practices

- **Highland Invocations** (Spellcasting): Ellara's prayers draw on both formal Eulogian liturgy and subtly incorporated highland traditions. She channels the Divine Light through unique invocations that manifest in ways typically unexpected from church clergy. While orthodox clerics might use standardized prayers, Ellara's connection allows her to improvise invocations that respond to the living world around her. (Druid spellcasting)

- **Sacred Ceremonies** (Ritual Casting): Performing extended prayer ceremonies that blend orthodox Eulogian rites with elements of highland tradition. These lengthy devotions don't require the same spiritual exertion as her more immediate invocations but take more time to complete.

- **Vessel of Light** (Wild Shape): In moments of deep communion, Ellara's connection to the Divine Light allows her physical form to temporarily transform, manifesting aspects of natural creatures. The Church might view this as either miraculous embodiment of the Light's creation or disturbing evidence of lingering pagan influence.

- **Ancient Highland Prayers** (Druidic Language): Among the prayers and liturgies Brother Theron taught Ellara was an ancient highland dialect, preserved through the generations by certain isolated Eulogian monasteries. This language contains unique terms and concepts for describing spiritual experiences that have no direct translation in Common. Brother Theron taught her these "historical curiosities," not realizing their power when combined with her Divine Spark. She can use this language to leave hidden blessings that only those with similar training can detect. She also has an innate connection with animals, allowing her to understand and speak with them. (Druidic + Speak with Animals)

- **Sunstone Focus** (Spellcasting Focus): Rather than the traditional holy symbol used by Capital clergy, Ellara channels her invocations through a small piece of sunstone from Arkos, carved with subtle markings that blend Eulogian symbols with older highland patterns.

- **Eulogian Devotions** (Primal Order): Ellara follows a specific devotional path within her unique blend of highland tradition and Eulogian faith. Her spiritual practices reflect both her formal church education and the ancient traditions of her homeland.

- **Highland Guardian** (Wild Companion): By performing a special invocation, Ellara can call forth a minor manifestation of the Divine Light in animal form. This luminous creature serves as her companion and helper, appearing as a small animal wreathed in gentle golden light. While orthodox clergy might question this practice, highland traditions speak of holy messengers taking animal forms.
<!-- 
- **Divine Resurgence** (Wild Resurgence): In moments of need, Ellara can draw deeply on her Divine Spark, trading one form of spiritual energy for another. She can channel the energy she would use for physical transformation into additional prayers, or sacrifice a prayer to fuel her transformation abilities.

- **Light's Wrath** (Elemental Fury): When provoked or protecting the innocent, Ellara can channel the Divine Light's more forceful aspects. This manifests either as empowered prayers (cantrips) that reach much further than normal, or as divine energy that infuses her transformed state with additional power. -->

## Circle of Dreams Replacement: Ancestral Highland Traditions

- **Light of Healing** (Balm of the Summer Court): Ellara channels the restorative power of the Divine Light through ancient highland prayer forms, creating glowing motes of sunstone-like light that heal those they touch.

<!-- - **Sanctuary of the Steadfast Light** (Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow): By performing a ritual combining orthodox prayers with subtle highland traditions, Ellara creates a protected space bathed in gentle illumination reminiscent of Arkos' sunstone.

- **Paths of Divine Revelation** (Hidden Paths): Drawing on her spiritual connection, Ellara briefly steps through the veil between physical and divine realms, allowing instantaneous travel as described in certain mystical Eulogian texts.

- **Communion of Souls** (Walker in Dreams): Through deep meditation using techniques taught by Brother Theron (though he may not have realized their full potential), Ellara can reach out to others through dream-like visions.

- **Nature Connection**: Her affinity with plants and animals comes from the highland interpretation of Eulogian teachings - that the Divine Light dwells within all creation and can be accessed through proper spiritual attunement. -->

## Quori Spirit Replacement: The Ancient Light

- **Origin**: The "Spirit" that awakened within Ellara represents [[TBD]], possibly tied to the Standing Stones. When manifesting, it appears as subtle illumination emanating from her hands or eyes.

- **Church Interpretation**: The orthodox Eulogian church might interpret this as either:
  * A divine blessing from the Light itself (progressive interpretation)
  * A dangerous remnant of pre-Eulogian "superstition" that needs purification (conservative view)

- **Manifestations**: In moments of spiritual intensity, Ellara might gain insights or visions connected to the ancient highland past, creating tension with her formal religious education.

- **Nature**: Unlike the alien quori spirits, Ellara's connection is to something indigenous to her homeland or church - specifics are [[TBD]].
