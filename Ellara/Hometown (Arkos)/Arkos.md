[[Arkos]] has a hardy, resilient, and somewhat insular atmosphere. Perched in the rugged highlands of the [[Hieroterra]] Province, life is shaped by the biting winds, the rocky terrain suitable mostly for tough sheep and goats, and the all-consuming presence of the [[Sunstone Quarry]]. 

The pale glow of [[Sunstone]] used in the [[Priory of the Steadfast Light]] and some older official buildings offers a stark contrast to the often grey, overcast skies. More recently, the discovery of [[Light Crystal]]s deep within the [[Sunstone Quarry]] (8 years ago, 643 AE) has begun to subtly alter the town's atmosphere and importance. There's a palpable sense of being on the edge â€“ of the Empire, of explored lands, and of conflicting beliefs.

This discovery of the crystals has only begun to alter the town's social fabric, aided by the fact that while they are important and have increased oversight by the [[Hariolar Empire|Empire]], there has not been a big influx of outsiders. Since locals have taken up the mantle of mining them through the existing [[Quarry Guild]] not *too* much has changed for them other than what they mine. The ocassional researcher or two will pass by the town making it a little more exposed to the outside world but surprisingly not too many others have come or settled.

Loyalty is primarily local, with a wary respect for the Priory's authority and a deeper, quieter reverence (or fear) for the ancient stones and the traditions surrounding them. Imperial presence, once felt mainly through stone quotas and occasional patrols, is slowly increasing due to the strategic value of the Light Crystals. This has heightened the low-simmering resentment beneath a veneer of compliance, as Imperial and Eulogian interest in the quarry and its artifacts grows. People are generally pragmatic, hardworking, and slow to trust outsiders, their caution now tinged with new anxieties and opportunities brought by the crystal discovery.
