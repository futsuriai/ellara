[[Arkos]] has a hardy, resilient, and somewhat insular atmosphere. Perched in the rugged highlands of the [[PROVINCE]] Province, life is shaped by the biting winds, the rocky terrain suitable mostly for tough sheep and goats, and the all-consuming presence of the [[Sunstone Quarry]]. 

The pale glow of [[Sunstone]] used in the [[Priory of the Steadfast Light]] and some older official buildings offers a stark contrast to the often grey, overcast skies. There's a palpable sense of being on the edge â€“ of the Empire, of explored lands, and of conflicting beliefs. Loyalty is primarily local, with a wary respect for the Priory's authority and a deeper, quieter reverence (or fear) for the ancient stones and the traditions surrounding them. Imperial presence is felt mainly through stone quotas, occasional patrols, and the Priory's doctrines, leading to a low-simmering resentment beneath a veneer of compliance. People are generally pragmatic, hardworking, and slow to trust outsiders.
