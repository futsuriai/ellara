[[Arkos]] is located deep within the [[PROVINCE]] Province, far from the Provincial [[Capital]]. Travel involves navigating rugged highland roads or possibly slower river routes originating further down. This distance maintains its provincial feel and allows local issues to develop away from immediate central scrutiny. 

Overland routes would probably take around 10 days if you had horses.
