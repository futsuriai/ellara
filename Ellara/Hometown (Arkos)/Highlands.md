# The Highlands

The Highlands region within the [[Hieroterra|Province]] is a remote, rugged, and sparsely populated area characterized by its challenging terrain, distinct culture, and unique resources. It is the region where [[Arkos]] is situated.

## Geography and Landscape

- **Terrain:** Dominated by rocky hills, craggy peaks, and windswept ridges. The land is often difficult to traverse, with narrow paths winding through valleys and over passes. Small, fast-flowing streams known locally as "burns" cut through the landscape.
- **Geology:** The region is notable for its deposits of [[Sunstone|Sunstone]], a pale, luminescent stone quarried extensively near [[Arkos|Arkos]]. Ancient megaliths and stone circles, known as the [[Highland Standing Stones|Highland Standing Stones]], are scattered throughout the area, remnants of pre-Eulogian times.
- **Settlements:** Settlements like [[Arkos|Arkos]] are typically small and located in sheltered valleys or near vital resources like springs or quarries. Buildings often utilize local materials, primarily stone, including [[Sunstone|Sunstone]].

## Flora and Fauna

- **Flora:** Vegetation is hardy, adapted to the harsh conditions. Common plants include heather, gorse, wild thyme, bog myrtle, and tough grasses. Gnarled trees like rowan cling to hillsides. Herbs with medicinal and ritual significance are gathered locally.
- **Fauna:** The region supports wildlife adapted to mountainous terrain, such as hardy sheep and goats tended by shepherds like [[Laos|Laos]], foxes, deer, and birds of prey like red kites.

## Climate and Atmosphere

- **Weather:** The Highlands are known for being windswept and often experiencing grey, overcast skies. Mist frequently settles in the valleys, especially during dawn and dusk. The air is generally thin, crisp, and cool, particularly at higher elevations and during the evenings. Winters can be harsh.
- **Feel:** The region has an atmosphere of remoteness, resilience, and ancient mystery. There's a palpable sense of being on the edge of the [[Hariolar Empire]]. The ever-present wind, the stark beauty of the landscape, and the ancient stones contribute to a unique, sometimes melancholic, character. Distinctive scents include damp earth, peat, heather, thyme, and bog myrtle.

## Culture and Beliefs

The people of the Highlands, including those in [[Arkos]], are known for their resilience, independence, and a strong connection to the land and its ancient history. While the [[Eulogia]] is the official religion, older traditions and beliefs often persist, sometimes subtly interwoven with Eulogian practices, sometimes existing in quiet opposition.
*   **Ancient Stones:** The Highlands are dotted with ancient standing stones, circles, and cairns, like the [[Highland Standing Stones]] (e.g., the Grey Sisters) near Arkos. Local folklore often attributes spiritual significance or power to these sites.
*   **Local Traditions:** Practices related to healing, divination, and appeasing local spirits or nature energies are common, often passed down through families. These are viewed with suspicion by orthodox Eulogian clergy like [[Abbot Aris]].

- **People:** Highlanders are typically pragmatic, hardworking, resilient, and often insular, slow to trust outsiders. Loyalty tends to be local.
- **Economy:** Primarily based on sheep farming, goat herding, and resource extraction, particularly [[Sunstone|Sunstone]] quarrying managed by entities like the [[Quarry Guild|Quarry Guild]].
- **Beliefs:** While the [[Eulogia/Eulogia Church|Eulogian Church]] has a presence, represented by institutions like the [[Priory of the Steadfast Light|Priory of the Steadfast Light]], older traditions and folk beliefs persist, often tied to the land and the [[Highland Standing Stones|Standing Stones]]. This creates ongoing tension between orthodox doctrine and local practices. There's a quiet reverence or fear regarding the ancient stones and associated spirits or ancestors.
