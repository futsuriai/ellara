The windswept, rocky highlands around [[Arkos]] are dotted with numerous pre-Eclipse megaliths and stone circles. Their origins are lost, but local folklore often associates them with **venerable ancestors** or **chthonic earth spirits**. The Eulogia actively discourages reverence for these stones, sometimes attempting to destroy or "reconsecrate" them, creating friction with families who maintain older traditions.

Strange phenomena are reported around the Standing Stones â€“ unusual glows (different from [[Sunstone]]), localized weather anomalies, unsettling whispers on the wind. Have recent events awakened something? 

Important ones:

- **The Grey Sisters:** A cluster of three tall, slender stones on a nearby ridge known for catching the wind and producing eerie whistling sounds.
- **The Ancestor's Perch:** A large, flat-topped megalith overlooking the quarry approach, traditionally used for leaving offerings (now officially forbidden and possibly watched by the Priory).
