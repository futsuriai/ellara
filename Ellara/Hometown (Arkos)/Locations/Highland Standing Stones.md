# Highland Standing Stones

## Description
Ancient megaliths, stone circles, and cairns scattered throughout the [[Highlands]] region near [[Arkos]]. Examples include the "Grey Sisters," three prominent stones on a ridge overlooking the valley.

These stones are visibly ancient, pre-dating the [[Eulogia]] and even the current settlements. Their surfaces are often weathered, covered in lichen, and sometimes bear faint, unidentifiable carvings.

## Local Folklore and Beliefs
Local traditions, often whispered and kept alive by figures like [[Morwen Stonehand]] and families with deep roots in the Highlands, attribute spiritual power and significance to these stones.
*   They are sometimes seen as markers of ancient burial sites, places of power, or gateways to other realms.
*   Rituals for luck, healing, or communing with ancestors were historically performed at these sites, though such practices are now heavily discouraged by the [[Eulogia]].

## Connection to Light Crystals
The discovery (8 years ago, 643 AE) in the nearby [[Sunstone Quarry]] of similar "Standing Stones" alongside [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]], with these quarry stones being identified as **artifacts from "The Age of Shadow,"** has cast the Highland Standing Stones in a new, more profound, and potentially more dangerous light.
*   [[Ellara]] has always felt a deep, almost instinctual connection to these stones, particularly the Grey Sisters. This connection now takes on a more significant and possibly unsettling meaning, potentially linking her own [[Spirit|spirit]] and abilities to these ancient, "Shadowed" origins.

## Significance to Ellara
For [[Ellara]], the Standing Stones are more than just landscape features. They are deeply intertwined with her identity, her childhood memories with [[Lyra Meadowlight]], and the very essence of her [[Spirit|spiritual connection]]. 

## Important Stones:

- **The Grey Sisters:** A cluster of three tall, slender stones on a nearby ridge known for catching the wind and producing eerie whistling sounds.
- **The Ancestor's Perch:** A large, flat-topped megalith overlooking the quarry approach, traditionally used for leaving offerings (now officially forbidden and possibly watched by the Priory).
