A functional, unadorned stone building near the [[Market Square]]. It serves as [[Kaelen Vance|Kaelen Vance's]] office and a meeting place for quarry-related matters (contracts, safety issues, quota negotiations).

The building is constructed of unpolished [[Sunstone]] blocks that give off a subtle ambient light, making evening meetings possible with minimal lamp oil. The main chamber features a large table where the [[Quarry Guild|Guild]] leadership holds meetings.

A smaller room serves as a shrine that acknowledges both the [[Eulogia|Eulogian faith]] (officially) and—through subtle carvings and symbols—the older traditions connected to the [[Highland Standing Stones|Standing Stones]]. Guild members often touch specific carvings for luck before heading to dangerous excavation sites.
