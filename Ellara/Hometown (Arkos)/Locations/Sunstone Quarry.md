[[Arkos]]'s main livelihood and source of external interest remains the quarry producing [[Sunstone]]. Run by the [[Quarry Guild]] led by [[Kaelen Vance]].

A large, open scar on the landscape near [[Arkos|Arkos]]. Constantly noisy during work hours with chipping hammers, blasting (if permitted/possible), and shouting workers. A dangerous but vital place.

The quarry represents the economic backbone of [[Arkos]].
