[[Arkos]]'s main livelihood and source of external interest remains the quarry producing [[Sunstone]]. Run by the [[Quarry Guild]] led by [[Kaelen Vance]].

A large, open scar on the landscape near [[Arkos|Arkos]]. Constantly noisy during work hours with chipping hammers, blasting (if permitted/possible), and shouting workers. A dangerous but vital place.

Work in the quarry is divided between extractors who identify and remove the raw stone, cutters who shape the rough blocks, polishers who prepare the final product, and haulers who manage the difficult transport down from the highlands. Injuries are common, and most families in Arkos have lost at least one member to quarry accidents over the generations.

The most valuable stones come from the deepest parts of the quarry, where workers sometimes report strange phenomena - unusual sounds, tools that move overnight, or particularly intense luminescence before major accidents. [[Old Man Hemlock]] insists on maintaining certain rituals before deep excavations, despite [[Brother Mikhael]]'s recent objections.

The quarry represents the economic backbone of [[Arkos]] but also serves as a physical manifestation of the tension between official Eulogian teachings and the older traditions that suggest the stone itself possesses consciousness or connection to ancestral spirits.
