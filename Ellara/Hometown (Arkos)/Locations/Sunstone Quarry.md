The [[Sunstone Quarry]] is the economic heart of [[Arkos]], a vast excavation site that has supplied the [[Eulogia]] and the [[Hariolar Empire]] with its signature faintly luminescent [[Sunstone]] for generations. It is located a few hours' walk from the town itself.

Work in the quarry is divided between extractors who identify and remove the raw stone, and cutters who shape it for transport or local use. The [[Quarry Guild]] oversees operations and negotiates with Imperial agents and is led by [[Kaelen Vance]].

Work in the quarry is divided between extractors who identify and remove the raw stone, cutters who shape the rough blocks, polishers who prepare the final product, and haulers who manage the difficult transport down from the highlands. Injuries are common, and most families in Arkos have lost at least one member to quarry accidents over the generations.

## Discovery of Light Crystals and Age of Shadow Artifacts
**A pivotal event occurred 8 years ago (643 AE):** Deep within the oldest sections of the Sunstone Quarry, miners unexpectedly unearthed not only traditional Sunstone but also veins of intensely glowing [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]]. Concurrent with this discovery were unusual formations of dark stone, identified as **"Standing Stones,"** which Imperial surveyors and Eulogian scholars later declared to be **apparent artifacts from "The Age of Shadow."**

This discovery has profoundly impacted the quarry and Arkos:
*   **Increased Imperial and Eulogian Interest:** The site is now of major strategic and theological importance.
*   **New Dangers and Precautions:** Mining in the deeper, Light Crystal-rich sections is considered more hazardous, with strange phenomena reported.
*   **Economic Shift:** While Sunstone remains important, Light Crystals are far more valuable, leading to new pressures and opportunities.

The most valuable stones (both Sunstone and Light Crystals) come from the deepest parts of the quarry, where workers sometimes report strange phenomena - unusual sounds, tools that move overnight, or particularly intense luminescence before major accidents. [[Old Man Hemlock]] insists on maintaining certain rituals before deep excavations, despite [[Brother Mikhael]]'s recent objections, which now carry the added weight of concern over "Shadowed" influences.

The quarry represents the economic backbone of [[Arkos]] but also serves as a physical manifestation of the tension between official Eulogian teachings (which initially condemned Light Crystals as "blasphemous" due to their Shadowed origin before finding theological justification) and the older traditions that suggest the stone itself possesses consciousness or connection to ancestral spirits.
