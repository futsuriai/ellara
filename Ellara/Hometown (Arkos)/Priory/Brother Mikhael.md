Recently arrived young priest (~20s). Zealous, book-learned, eager to impress superiors by 'reforming' [[Eulogia Church|Eulogian Church's]] approach to the region.

Ambitious and doctrinaire, Mikhael views his posting to this remote highland Priory as both a test and an opportunity to prove himself worthy of advancement. He's been systematically documenting "heretical practices" in the region and appears particularly interested in the [[Highland Standing Stones]].

Has begun pushing for stricter enforcement of Eulogian orthodoxy than even [[Abbot Aris]] implemented, creating new tensions with townsfolk. According to [[Brother Sorin]]'s careful hints in correspondence, Mikhael seems unusually interested in [[Ellara]]'s history at the Priory and has been reviewing old records of her time there.

Determined to "cleanse" Arkos of its "backward superstitions," potentially threatening the uneasy balance between traditional practices and official Eulogian worship.

## Zeal and Reforming Spirit
Brother Mikhael is driven by a fervent desire to purify [[Arkos]] of what he perceives as lingering pagan influences and doctrinal laxity. He sees the local traditions, particularly those connected to the [[Highland Standing Stones]] and any reverence for "spirits" outside the Eulogia, as heretical.

His zeal may be particularly inflamed by the ongoing [[Light Crystal]] controversy within the [[Eulogia]]. The Church's acceptance of these powerful artifacts, despite their origins in "The Age of Shadow" and initial condemnation as "Shadowed," might be a point of contention for him. He could view the situation in Arkos, with its own ancient stones and local beliefs now uncomfortably close to the source of these "Shadowed" crystals, as a critical front in a spiritual war. He may be looking for more Light Crystals, trying to suppress any perceived "Shadowed" worship, or ensuring absolute orthodoxy around these potent and dangerous discoveries.

## Interest in "Heretical Practices" and Standing Stones
He has taken a particular, negative interest in the [[Highland Standing Stones]] and any local folklore surrounding them. He views them not as historical curiosities but as active sites of potential heresy. This interest is now more significant given that the Standing Stones are linked to "The Age of Shadow" and the discovery of [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]]. Mikhael might see it as his duty to sever any connection the locals have to these places and their potentially "Shadowed" power.
