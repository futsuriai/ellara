Recently arrived young priest (~20s). Zealous, book-learned, eager to impress superiors by 'reforming' [[Eulogia Church|Eulogian Church's]] approach to the region.

Ambitious and doctrinaire, Mikhael views his posting to this remote highland Priory as both a test and an opportunity to prove himself worthy of advancement. He's been systematically documenting "heretical practices" in the region and appears particularly interested in the [[Highland Standing Stones]].

Has begun pushing for stricter enforcement of Eulogian orthodoxy than even [[Abbot Aris]] implemented, creating new tensions with townsfolk. According to [[Brother Theron]]'s careful hints in correspondence, Mikhael seems unusually interested in [[Ellara]]'s history at the Priory and has been reviewing old records of her time there.

Determined to "cleanse" Arkos of its "backward superstitions," potentially threatening the uneasy balance between traditional practices and official Eulogian worship.
