Lay Brother (~50s). A local [[Arkos|Arkos]] man who took vows later in life. Handles maintenance, groundskeeping, and guards the gate at the [[Priory of the Steadfast Light|Priory]]. Loyal to the Priory structure but probably has more sympathy/understanding for local ways than the ordained priests.
