### **Outer Wall & Gatehouse:**  
A sturdy wall made mostly of stacked [[Sunstone]] encloses the Priory grounds. The main gate is a simple, heavy wooden door set in a stone archway, often manned by [[Gareth Stonehand]].
 
### **Courtyard:** 
  A windswept, roughly paved courtyard lies beyond the gate. A central, moss-covered well provides water. Perhaps a single, tall standing stone, carved with Eulogian symbols, serves as a large sundial near the main building's entrance – a clear symbol of appropriation.
  
### **Main Building (L-Shaped):**
 - _Ground Floor:_ A modest entrance hall leads to the large **Refectory** (dining hall) with long wooden tables. Adjacent are the **Kitchens** and pantries. A small **Infirmary** chamber, smelling strongly of herbs, is tended by [[Abbot Aris]]. [[Brother Theron]]'s sparse **Office**, containing records and theological texts, is also on this floor, perhaps near the entrance.
- _Upper Floor:_ The **Chapel** occupies a significant portion, relatively plain but featuring [[Sunstone]] in the altar and window frames, catching the light. Opposite or nearby is the small **Scriptorium**, with a few desks for copying texts and storing records (where Elara spent much time).
### **Scriptorium**:
A writing room  for the copying and illuminating of manuscripts by scribes.
### **Dormitory Wing:** 
Connected to the main building, this wing contains rows of small, identical stone cells for the priests, sisters (in a separate section), and any initiates. Furnishings are minimal – a cot, a small chest, a niche for a holy symbol.
## **Garden:** 
A vital, high-walled **Herb and Vegetable Garden** is situated in a sheltered spot behind the main building, protected from the worst of the highland winds. Carefully tended by [[Brother Theron]] and helpers, it's crucial for food and remedies.
### **Bell Tower:** 
Attached to the Chapel, its bell tolls the hours for prayer and serves as a landmark for the town.
### **Cellars:**
Likely storage cellars beneath the main building, possibly incorporating older, pre-Eulogian stonework from ruins found on the site when the Priory was constructed.
