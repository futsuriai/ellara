- **The Harsh Winter (approx. 15 years ago):** A particularly brutal winter led to famine and loss. While the Priory offered aid, whispers blamed the hardship on neglecting the old ancestor/spirit rituals, causing a quiet resurgence in those practices despite [[Abbot Aris]]'s condemnation. This is when [[Lyra Meadowlight]]'s mother died.

- **Imperial Surveyors & Light Crystal Discovery (approx. 8 years ago - 643 AE):**
    *   **Crucial Link:** This was not just a routine survey. Imperial surveyors, possibly following up on unusual reports or geological studies, were present during or immediately investigated the **accidental discovery of [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]] and "Standing Stones" deep within the [[Sunstone Quarry]]**.
    *   The "ultimate purpose" of their prolonged stay became clear: to assess the scope and significance of this major technological and historical find, and to establish Imperial and Eulogian claims and control over these potent, "Shadowed" resources. This event marked the beginning of increased Imperial scrutiny and intervention in Arkos.

- **[[Abbot Aris]]'s Crackdown on Local Traditions (approx. 5 years ago):**
    *   This could be a direct reaction to the unease, theological debates, and potential resurgence of "heretical" interest in local "superstitions" stirred by the Light Crystal discovery and their controversial "Shadowed" origins. Her desire to enforce orthodoxy might have been a response to fears of "Shadowed" influence resurfacing or local practices gaining dangerous new meaning.

- **[[Ellara]]'s Transfer to [[Bastion City]] (6 months ago):**
    *   The timing means the Light Crystal revolution is well underway across the Empire, and [[Bastion City]] is its hub. Her "strange gifts," potentially perceived by Aris as dangerously "Shadowed" in nature (akin to the Light Crystals' origin), would be viewed with even more suspicion and urgency in this context, prompting her transfer for "study" and containment.

- **Arrival of [[Brother Mikhael]] (approx. 2 months ago):** A young, zealous priest from the capital (or at least a more central seminary) arrived recently, assigned to assist Abbot Sorin. His rigid interpretations and eagerness to 'purify' Akros are already causing waves.
