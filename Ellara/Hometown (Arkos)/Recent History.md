- **The Harsh Winter (approx. 15 years ago):** A particularly brutal winter led to famine and loss. While the Priory offered aid, whispers blamed the hardship on neglecting the old ancestor/spirit rituals, causing a quiet resurgence in those practices despite [[Abbot Aris]]'s condemnation. This is when [[Lyra Meadowlight]]'s mother died.

- **Imperial Surveyors (approx. 8 years ago):** A team of Imperial geologists and Eulogian scholars arrived to survey the Sunstone Quarry and catalogue the Standing Stones. Their intrusive methods and dismissal of local beliefs caused significant friction and deepened mistrust of outsiders. They left with detailed maps and stone samples, but their ultimate purpose remains unclear to the townsfolk.

- **[[Abbot Aris]]'s Crackdown (approx. 5 years ago):** Following perceived defiance after the surveyors left, she instituted stricter enforcement of Eulogian observances and punishments for anyone caught making offerings at the stones, leading to several public reprimands and increased tension.

- **[[Ellara]]'s Transfer (approx. 6 months ago):** [[Ellara]]'s departure is still fresh gossip, shrouded in rumour. Was she truly sent for higher study, or did her strange 'gifts' finally cross a line with the Abbot? Her absence is felt, particularly by those few she was close to.

- **Arrival of [[Brother Mikhael]] (approx. 2 months ago):** A young, zealous priest from the capital (or at least a more central seminary) arrived recently, assigned to assist Abbot Sorin. His rigid interpretations and eagerness to 'purify' Akros are already causing waves.
