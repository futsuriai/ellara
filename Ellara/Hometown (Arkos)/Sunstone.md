Pale, faintly luminescent stone favoured for [[Eulogia|Eulogian]] construction. The [[Sunstone Quarry|quarry]] dominates the local economy and landscape of [[Arkos]]. 

Managed primarily by the [[Quarry Guild]], the stone extraction provides the main livelihood for many of [[Arkos]]'s residents. The unique properties of Sunstone—both practical and potentially spiritual—make it a valuable resource that connects the remote town to the wider [[PROVINCE|Province]] and [[Capital|Empire]].

Physically, the stone has unique properties - it absorbs sunlight during the day and emits a gentle, warm glow for hours afterward. This property makes it highly prized for temples and important buildings throughout the province. When properly cut and polished, finer specimens can hold their luminescence for days.

Local folklore suggests the stone formed when ancestral spirits captured fragments of sunlight during the mythical [[TBD]][[CATACLYSM]]" that begins Eulogian records. The church officially dismisses such stories as superstition, claiming the stone's properties are simply a divine blessing on their righteous expansion into the highlands.
