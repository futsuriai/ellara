Physically, the stone has unique properties - it absorbs sunlight during the day and emits a gentle, warm glow for hours afterward. This property makes it highly prized for temples and important buildings throughout the province. When properly cut and polished, finer specimens can hold their luminescence for days.

Local folklore suggests the stone formed when ancestral spirits captured fragments of sunlight during the mythical "Long Night" that predates Eulogian records. The church officially dismisses such stories as superstition, claiming the stone's properties are simply a divine blessing on their righteous expansion into the highlands.
