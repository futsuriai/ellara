Pale, faintly luminescent stone favoured for [[Eulogian]] construction. The [[Sunstone Quarry|quarry]] dominates the local economy and landscape of [[Arkos]]. The stone is particularly valued in [[Eulogia|Eulogian]] buildings for its symbolic connection to [[Eulogia's Divine Light|Eulogia's Divine Light]].

Managed primarily by the [[Quarry Guild]], the stone extraction provides the main livelihood for many of [[Arkos]]'s residents. The unique properties of Sunstone—both practical and potentially spiritual—make it a valuable resource that connects the remote town to the wider [[PROVINCE|Province]] and [[Capital|Empire]].
