Pale, faintly luminescent stone favoured for [[Eulogia|Eulogian]] construction. The [[Sunstone Quarry|quarry]] dominates the local economy and landscape of [[Arkos]]. Alongside traditional Sunstone, the quarry has, for the past 8 years, also been a source of the more potent and controversial [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]], found in its deeper sections and linked to "The Age of Shadow."

Managed primarily by the [[Quarry Guild]], the stone extraction provides the main livelihood for many of [[Arkos]]'s residents. The unique properties of Sunstone—both practical and potentially spiritual—make it a valuable resource that connects the remote town to the wider [[Hieroterra|Province]] and [[Hariolar Empire|Empire]]. The discovery of Light Crystals has amplified this connection and the strategic importance of Arkos.

Physically, Sunstone has unique properties - it absorbs sunlight during the day and emits a gentle, warm glow for hours afterward. This property makes it highly prized for temples and important buildings throughout the province. When properly cut and polished, finer specimens can hold their luminescence for days.

Local folklore, often dismissed by the Priory, suggests that Sunstone resonates with the land's spirit and that the [[Highland Standing Stones]] are ancient markers of its power. The discovery of Light Crystals alongside "Age of Shadow" artifacts in the same quarry has given new, unsettling dimensions to these old beliefs.
