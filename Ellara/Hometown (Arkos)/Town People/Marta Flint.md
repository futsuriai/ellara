The stout, observant owner and operator of The [[Stone Hearth Tavern]]. Her establishment is the main social hub outside the Priory. She hears everything, knows everyone's business, but keeps her opinions mostly to herself. Offers simple, hearty food, locally brewed ale (or imported spirits), and a warm fire â€“ a neutral ground for locals, quarry workers, and the occasional visitor.
