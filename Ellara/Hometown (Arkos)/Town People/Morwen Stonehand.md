An elderly woman living on the edge of town, possibly related to [[Gareth Stonehand]] at the Priory. She serves as the town's unofficial herbalist and midwife, practicing older folk remedies passed down through generations. Some townsfolk seek her out secretly, especially when Priory methods fail or for matters the Priory condemns. [[Abbot Aris]] views her with deep suspicion.

As a child, [[Lyra Meadowlight|Lyra Meadowlight's]] mother was ill, though ultimately unable to save her.
