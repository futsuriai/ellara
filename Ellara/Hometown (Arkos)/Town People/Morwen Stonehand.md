An elderly woman living on the edge of town, possibly related to [[Gareth Stonehand]] at the Priory. She serves as the town's unofficial herbalist and midwife, practicing older folk remedies passed down through generations. Some townsfolk seek her out secretly, especially when Priory methods fail or for matters the Priory condemns. [[Abbot Aris]] views her with deep suspicion.

When [[Lyra Meadowlight|Lyra's]] mother fell gravely ill with a wasting fever, the family sought help from both the Priory and Morwen. As the illness progressed, Morwen requested [[Ellara]]'s assistance in gathering specific herbs, knowing the girl had been trained by [[Brother Sorin]]. During the treatment, [[Ellara]]'s first spiritual manifestation occurred - a sudden glow emanating from her hands as she held the dying woman's arm. Though Lyra's mother ultimately passed away, this event created an unbreakable bond between [[Ellara]] and [[Lyra Meadowlight|Lyra]], as well as deepening [[Abbot Aris]]'s concerns about [[Ellara]]'s unusual connection to something beyond orthodox Eulogian faith.

Morwen has since watched [[Ellara]] from a distance, recognizing something in the girl that connects to older highland traditions, despite [[Ellara]]'s fear and avoidance of her.

## Beliefs and Practices
Morwen is a keeper of the older highland traditions, those that predate or exist alongside the [[Eulogia]]. She has a deep knowledge of herbal remedies, local folklore, and the significance of sites like the [[Highland Standing Stones]].

## Relationship with Ellara
Morwen was present when [[Ellara]] had her first significant spiritual manifestation, during the passing of [[Lyra Meadowlight]]'s mother. While [[Abbot Aris]] reacted with fear, suspecting something dangerously "Shadowed" (a fear amplified by the recent [[Light Crystal]] discoveries and their controversial origins), Morwen may have seen something different â€“ a raw, powerful connection to the ancient energies of the land, perhaps even a sign of the old ways reawakening. She likely tried to offer guidance or protection to Ellara in her own way, which would have further alarmed Abbot Aris.
