The town's highest-ranking civil official, appointed by provincial Imperial authority but reliant on local cooperation. A middle-aged man perpetually stressed, trying to balance Imperial demands (especially [[Sunstone]] quotas), the Priory's expectations, and the townsfolk's needs and stubborn traditions. He likely maintains a wary relationship with [[Abbot Aris]]. His office is small and functional, attached to his modest home.
