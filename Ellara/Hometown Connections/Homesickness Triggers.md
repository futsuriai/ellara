# Homesickness Triggers

Certain experiences in the [[Arkos|Arkos]] and her former life:

## Sensory Triggers

- **Stonework and Masonry** - Seeing skilled stoneworkers reminds her of the [[Sunstone Quarry|Sunstone Quarry]] and its importance to Arkos. She often stops to watch masons in the Capital, sometimes bringing them water as she would for quarry workers back home.

- **Highland Herbs** - The rare sight or scent of familiar highland herbs in the Capital marketplace can bring tears to her eyes. She occasionally overpays for these just to have them in her quarters.

- **Weather Patterns** - The first snowfall of winter, fog settling in valleys, or particular cloud formations that mirror the highland skies of home make her particularly withdrawn.

- **Country Accents** - Hearing highland or provincial accents similar to those from Arkos in the crowded Capital streets makes her seek out the speakers, though she rarely approaches them.

## Emotional Triggers

- **Festival Days** - Traditional Eulogian celebrations observed differently in the Capital highlight cultural differences. The solstice celebration particularly makes her miss home, as Arkos had unique traditions.

- **Community Meals** - The formal, hierarchical dining of the Capital clergy contrasts sharply with the communal meals at the Priory, making her feel isolated even in company.

## Response Patterns

When homesickness overwhelms her, Ellara typically:
- Touches her [[Sunstone]] pendant
- When possible retreats to her quarters to organize her [[Keepsakes|personal mementos]]
- Writes detailed letters to [[Lyra Meadowlight]] but doesn't send them as she doesn't want her friend to think she's struggling.
