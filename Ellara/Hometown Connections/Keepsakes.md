# Keepsakes

Ellara keeps several precious items from [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Arkos|Arkos]] that connect her to home:

## Religious Items

- **Personal Prayer Book** - Hand-copied by Ellara during her initiate training, with margin notes from [[../Relationships/Brother Sorin|Brother Sorin]] that contain a unique perspective not found in [[Bastion City]]. Contains traditional prayers and hymns specific to the Highland practice of Eulogia that differ slightly from Capital versions in wording.

- **Miniature [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Sunstone|Sunstone]] Talisman** - A small polished stone from the [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Locations/Sunstone Quarry|quarry]] carved with the symbol of Eulogia mixed with some Highland themes. Given to her by [[Gareth Stonehand|Gareth Stonehand]] when she was young She keeps it in her pocket and often touches it when stressed.

- **Ceremonial Herb Pouch** - A small leather pouch containing dried herbs from the Priory garden, used in her personal rituals. Includes highland herbs not commonly found in the Capital.

## Personal Mementos

- **Pressed Wildflowers** - Collected with [[../Relationships/Lyra Meadowlight|Lyra]] during childhood adventures, preserved between pages of her personal writings.

- **River Stone** - A smooth, flat stone from the creek near the [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Locations/Highland Standing Stones|Highland Standing Stones]]. Ellara uses it as a meditation focus during her private communion with the [[../Spirit/Spirit|Spirit]].

- **Hand-carved Wooden Bird** - A small, simple carving given to her by Initiate [[Lyra Meadowlight]] before her departure. She keeps it on her small personal altar.

- **Map of Arkos** - Hand-drawn by Ellara, marking significant personal locations rather than official landmarks. She sometimes traces the paths with her finger before sleep, mentally walking through her hometown.

## Physical Reminders

- **Lyra's Bracelet** - A handwoven bracelet made of local fibers dyed with mineral pigments from the quarry, given to her by [[../Relationships/Lyra Meadowlight|Lyra]] the night before she left for the Capital. She keeps it wrapped in a cloth and hidden among her modest possessions, only wearing it in private moments of meditation or when she feels particularly alone.

- **Folded Note** - A carefully preserved scrap of parchment with the words "Find me in the light between worlds" written in Lyra's flowing script. Ellara isn't certain whether this refers to prayer, dreams, or something connected to the old ways, but she treasures the connection it represents.

- **Highland Soil** - A small vial of earth from near the Priory garden, taken in secret before her departure. Sometimes when homesickness is overwhelming, she opens it briefly to smell the distinctive scent of home.

- **Journal Pages** - Several loose pages from her childhood journals containing pressed flowers from walks with Lyra, with dates and locations noted in her neat script.
