# Keepsakes

Ellara keeps several precious items from [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Arkos|Arkos]] that connect her to home:

## Religious Items

- **Personal Prayer Book** - Hand-copied by Ellara during her initiate training, with margin notes from [[../Relationships/Brother Theron|Brother Theron]] that contain a unique perspective not found in the [[Capital|Capital]]. Contains traditional prayers and hymns specific to the Highland practice of Eulogia that differ slightly from Capital versions in wording.

- **Miniature [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Sunstone|Sunstone]] Talisman** - A small polished stone from the [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Locations/Sunstone Quarry|quarry]] carved with the symbol of Eulogia. Given to her by [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Priory/Gareth Stonehand|Gareth Stonehand]] upon her departure. She keeps it in her pocket and often touches it when stressed.

- **Ceremonial Herb Pouch** - A small leather pouch containing dried herbs from the Priory garden, used in her personal rituals. Includes highland herbs not commonly found in the Capital.

## Personal Mementos

- **Pressed Wildflowers** - Collected with [[../Relationships/Lyra Meadowlight|Lyra]] during childhood adventures, preserved between pages of her personal writings.

- **River Stone** - A smooth, flat stone from the creek near the [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Locations/Highland Standing Stones|Highland Standing Stones]]. Ellara uses it as a meditation focus during her private communion with the [[../Spirit/Spirit|Spirit]].

- **Hand-carved Wooden Bird** - A small, simple carving given to her by Initiate [[Lyra Meadowvale]] before her departure. She keeps it on her small personal altar.

## Hidden Treasures

- **Folk Remedy Journal** - A small notebook containing traditional remedies learned from watching [[../Hometown (Arkos)/Town People/Morwen Stonehand|Morwen Stonehand]], despite her fear of the woman. Ellara keeps this hidden as some Capital clergy might consider these practices questionable.

- **Map of Arkos** - Hand-drawn by Ellara, marking significant personal locations rather than official landmarks. She sometimes traces the paths with her finger before sleep, mentally walking through her hometown.
