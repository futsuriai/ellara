My Dearest Lyra,

Today was... eventful. The Capital is truly a world away from Arkos, isn't it? We had an alms giving, and I was helping distribute food. I wish I could say I find the sheer number of people less overwhelming by now, certainly you would have adjusted faster than I have. The streets are alive with noise and color, but it all feels so foreign. I miss the quiet of our village, the gentle rustle of leaves, and the soft sounds of the creek.

I met some interesting individuals. A halfling, Berridin, with a striking gold streak in his hair that made me instantly think he was Light-Touched... he reminded me a little of the mischievous sprites from the old tales, though he seemed harmless enough. Then a towering Goliath named Ysidor appeared, so stunned by the city's light, it was quite a sight! He was very loud but seemed kind. Shadowed as though he may be I may have been able help him start his journey to the Light. A Shadowed elf named Nyx who seemed surprisingly patient and a young woman, Tsi'nyra, also came by. She seemed a little lost, much like I often feel here. Nites has tested me today but I must remind myself the Shadowed fear the Light because they do not know It, not because they wish to. It's strange, Lyra, to be surrounded by so many and yet feel so profoundly alone at times. I find myself touching the sunstone talisman me more often than I'd like to admit.

I believe the Divine Spark has arranged this meeting for a reason. I felt a strange connection with them, as if we were all drawn together by some unseen force. I hope to learn more about their stories and perhaps help them find their way to the Light.

I wonder if you are out by the Standing Stones, perhaps gathering wildflowers as the sun sets. I traced the paths on my map of Arkos last night, imagining I was walking them with you. Do you remember that little creek where we used to look for smooth stones? I still have the one I found that day.

I hope this letter finds you well. Write back when you can.

Find me in the light between worlds.

Yours,
Ellara

My Dearest Ellara,

Your letter arrived like a breath of highland air, though I wish it carried happier news of your settling in. The Capital sounds just as overwhelming as we feared, perhaps more so. Don't let its noise and strangeness dim your own light, Ellara. Remember the resilience of the heather on our hills; it bends in the wind but is not broken.

It'sâ€¦ interesting to hear about the people you've met. A "Light-Touched" halfling and a Goliath "stunned by the city's light"... you always did see the world through the Priory's lens, didn't you? Be careful, Ellara. Not everything that glitters is sunstone, and not all shadows are empty of wisdom. Trust your own heart, the one that grew strong in Arkos, not just the teachings you carry. That "Shadowed elf" and the lost young woman... perhaps they are just people, like us, trying to find their way. Your Divine Spark may have brough them to you to teach you something, but remember that you are not just a vessel for the Light. You are a person, too.

Arkos is much the same. The wind still whistles through the Grey Sisters, and I walked by our creek yesterday. The water runs clear, and I almost expected to see you there, skipping stones. I picked a few wildflowers from the meadow, the ones you always liked, and pressed them. The quarry is busy, as always, and Brother Sorin asked after you the other day. I told him you were no doubt dazzling them all with your piety. He smiled in that knowing way he has.

I still have the little bird you carved for me. It sits on my windowsill and watches the path to the Standing Stones. I go there sometimes, when the quiet of the town feels too loud in your absence.

Thank you for sharing your days with me, even the lonely parts. Hold onto that sunstone, let it be your anchor. And know that even across all this distance, you are not truly alone.

Find me in the light between worlds.

Yours,
Lyra
