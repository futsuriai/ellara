# Character Flaws

Despite her genuine devotion and good intentions, Ellara has several notable character flaws:

## Intellectual Flaws

- **Theological Naivety** - Having been sheltered in Arkos, she sometimes makes embarrassing doctrinal mistakes in Capital theological discussions, not realizing certain interpretations were declared outdated or are not in vogue. She's working hard to say the right ones.
  
## Social Flaws

- **Judgmental Tendencies** - While presenting as accepting, privately judges Capital clergy who seem more focused on politics than faith. Her disapproval occasionally shows in microexpressions.
  
- **Conversational Tunnel Vision** - Once engaged in discussing matters of faith, fails to notice when others grow bored or uncomfortable, continuing with religious insights when social cues suggest changing the subject.
  
- **Misplaced Trust** - Too quick to assume best intentions from those who show interest in highland traditions or the church, potentially making her vulnerable to manipulation.

## Emotional Flaws

- **Suppressed Anger** - Bottles up frustrations about being removed from her home and treated with suspicion, occasionally resulting in passive-aggressive behavior or unexpected emotional outbursts.
  
- **Superiority Complex** - Despite outward humility, harbors a secret belief that she knows better than most, even than trained scholars of theology.
  
- **Fear of Abandonment** - Excessively concerned with pleasing authority figures due to early orphaning and dependence on the Priory community, sometimes compromising her values for approval.

## Spiritual Flaws

- **Ritual Dependence** - Becomes anxious and disoriented when unable to perform her private spiritual rituals, showing an unhealthy attachment to specific practices.
  
- **Dogmatic Flexibility** - Inconsistently applies religious rulesâ€”strictly adhering to highland interpretations she agrees with while not finding justifications to bend other doctrinal points that she didn't grow up with.

## How These Flaws Manifest

- In moments of stress, reverts to quoting scripture rather than expressing her own thoughts
- Occasionally cancels social engagements if they conflict with her personal ritual schedule
