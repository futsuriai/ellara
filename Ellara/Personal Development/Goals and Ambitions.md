# Goals and Ambitions

Ellara's aspirations in [[Bastion City]] reflect both her personal growth and her dedication to the [[Eulogia|Eulogian]] faith, now set against the backdrop of the [[Light Crystal]] revolution and the theological debates surrounding their use.

## Short-Term Goals (Current Focus in Bastion City)
*   **Understand Her Spirit:** To find answers about the nature of her [[Spirit|spiritual abilities]], especially in light of their potential connection to "Shadowed" powers and the energies of [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]]. She hopes the scholars and archives in Bastion City, a hub for Light Crystal research, might offer insights, even if she must seek them discreetly.
*   **Theological Study:** To deepen her understanding of Eulogian doctrine. She wants to reconcile her faith with the complex new realities that have emerged in the last decade.
*   **Serve the Eulogia:** To prove herself a worthy and devout servant of the Eulogia within the more complex and demanding environment of [[Bastion City]].
*   **Adapt to City Life:** To navigate the social and cultural challenges of the bustling provincial capital, which is vastly different from [[Arkos]].

## Long-Term Aspirations
*   **Reconcile Faith and Spirit:** To find a way to integrate her unique spiritual experiences and abilities with her Eulogian faith, ideally finding acceptance and understanding within the Church rather than condemnation.
*   **Help Others:** To use her abilities and understanding to genuinely help others, whether in [[Bastion City]] or, if she ever returns, in [[Arkos]].
*   **Understand Lyra's Path:** To reconnect with [[Lyra Meadowlight]] and understand the path her friend is on, especially concerning the old ways and the [[Highland Standing Stones]].

## Potential Conflicts with Goals
*   The Eulogia's fear and suspicion of uncontrolled spiritual power and "Shadowed" influences could directly threaten her quest for understanding and acceptance.
*   Her loyalty to her Highland roots and friends like Lyra might conflict with the expectations and demands of the Eulogian hierarchy in [[Bastion City]].
