# Inner Conflicts

Ellara struggles with several deep tensions:

## Faith Conflicts

- **Orthodoxy vs. Personal Experience** - Constantly battles between the rigid theological framework of Capital Eulogia and her direct spiritual experiences that don't always align with doctrine. The more traditional practices she learned through [[Lyra Meadowlight]] are also there in the background.
- **Eulogia's Handling of Light Crystals:** The [[Eulogia]]'s initial condemnation of [[Light Crystal]]s (due to their "Shadowed" origin) and subsequent pragmatic theological justification for their use is a significant source of internal conflict. Does this reveal a flaw in the Church's infallibility? Is it a necessary adaptation? How does this reflect on her own abilities?

## Cultural Tensions

- **Highland Identity vs. Capital Assimilation** - Fears losing her cultural roots while simultaneously wanting to fit into Capital society and gain legitimacy and not be seen as an uncouth Highlander provincial.
  
- **Communal Values vs. Hierarchical Structure** - Raised with highland communal ethics that conflict with the rigid hierarchy and individual advancement in Capital religious institutions. The sense of community in [[Arkos]] is harder to find in the more impersonal structures of the [[Bastion City]]  church.
  
- **Practical Spirituality vs. Theological Abstraction** - Loves learning about and discussing purely theoretical religious debates even when faith in [[Arkos]] was about concrete community needs.

## Interpersonal Dilemmas

- **Respecting Authority vs. Independent Thought** - Deeply ingrained respect for religious authority clashes with her growing sense that the Spirit is trying to warn her something is off.
  
- **Honesty vs. Self-Preservation** - Torn between full disclosure about her spiritual experiences and the necessity of discretion to avoid suspicion or censure. She misses people she can fully trust.
  
- **Loyalty to Mentors vs. New Influences** - Feels conflicted about embracing new religious perspectives that might contradict [[../Relationships/Abbot Aris|Abbot Aris]]'s teachings but is used to being acknowledged by her mentors.

## Spiritual Identity Crisis

- **Gift vs. Burden** - Alternates between viewing her unique spiritual abilities as a divine blessing and as a dangerous liability that isolates her.
- **Uncertainty about the source and meaning of her [[Spirit|spiritual abilities]]. Are they a divine gift, a dangerous anomaly, or something connected to the ancient, "Shadowed" powers now being unearthed with Light Crystals? Her connection to the [[Highland Standing Stones]] deepens this crisis.
  
- **Past vs. Future** - Uncertain whether to seek advancement within the Capital church structure or return to Arkos one day.
