# Skills to Develop

Ellara is actively working to acquire new abilities and knowledge in the Capital:

## Theological Skills

- **Formal Debate** - Learning the structured theological debate methods favored in the Capital's academic circles. Still uncomfortable with it but tries a bit too hard and overplays her skill in it.

- **Ancient Languages** - Studied the liturgical language much more than most due to growing up in the church with a traditional Abbot.

## Social Skills

- **Court Etiquette** - Struggling to master the complex social hierarchies and protocols of Capital religious ceremonies that interact with nobility.

- **Political Awareness** - Developing a better understanding of church politics and factions, learning which battles to fight and which to concede.

- **Diplomatic Speech** - Working to express her highland theological views in language acceptable to Capital clergy, finding middle ground without compromising core beliefs.

## Practical Skills

- **Advanced Herbalism** - Expanding her knowledge beyond highland remedies to include exotic ingredients available only in the Capital.

- **Record Keeping** - Learning proper church documentation methods required for any position of authority.

- **City Navigation** - Slowly mapping the confusing layout of the Capital in her mind, gradually venturing further from the church district.

## Spirit Connection

- **Controlled Manifestation** - Cautiously experimenting with directing and focusing her spirit abilities rather than just experiencing them.

- **Discretion** - Developing better awareness of when her connection to the Spirit might manifest to avoid looking weird in front of others.
