Aris wasn't born in the [[PROVINCE]] Province. He hails from a more central, "civilized" region of the Empire, where adherence to Eulogian doctrine is unquestioned and ancient 'superstitions' are things of history books. 

He arrived in [[Arkos]] over thirty years ago as a relatively young, ambitious priest, eager to bring the full light of the Eulogia to this 'backward' region. He envisioned quickly rooting out old ways and making [[Arkos]] a shining example of compliance. However, he found the local traditions far more ingrained and resistant than he anticipated. Early attempts at forceful conversion or debunking local beliefs often backfired, leading to sullen resentment rather than acceptance. 

A significant incident perhaps involved his failure to 'cure' a blight on local livestock through prayer alone, while an old folk remedy seemingly worked, deeply embarrassing him. 

Over the decades, his youthful fire has cooled into rigid orthodoxy and dour persistence. He sees the local ways not just as wrong, but as a personal affront and a sign of his own failure to fully impose order. He genuinely cares for the souls under his charge (as he understands it) but believes salvation lies _only_ in strict adherence to the Eulogia. [[Ellara]]'s manifestations likely terrified him â€“ was this a true spark of the Divine he couldn't control, or a dangerous echo of the very local 'spirit worship' he'd fought for years to suppress? 

Sending her away was, in his mind, the only safe option.
