Brother Theron was a steady and compassionate presence in Ellara's life, offering a warmth that balanced the Priory's often austere environment. He had a knack for recognizing when someone needed encouragement or a listening ear, and he often took the time to teach Ellara practical skills like tending the herb garden, repairing tools, or preparing simple meals. These lessons were always accompanied by gentle wisdom, often shared through stories of his own youth or parables that subtly reinforced the values of kindness and patience.

Unlike Abbot Aris, whose focus was on strict adherence to doctrine, Brother Theron believed in meeting people where they were. He understood that faith was as much about compassion as it was about discipline, and he often acted as a mediator when tensions arose between the Priory's leadership and the townsfolk. For Ellara, he became a surrogate parent of sorts, someone she could turn to for guidance without fear of judgment.

Theron also had a quiet sense of humor that he used to lighten the mood during difficult times. When Ellara struggled with her studies or felt overwhelmed by her responsibilities, he would find small ways to make her smileâ€”a well-timed joke, a shared treat from the kitchen, or a simple reminder that even the most devout needed moments of levity. His presence was a reminder that the Priory, for all its rules and rituals, was still a place of human connection and care.
