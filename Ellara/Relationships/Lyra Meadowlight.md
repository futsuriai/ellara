Lyra grew up in [[Arkos|Arkos]], her family perhaps one of those quietly known for maintaining closer ties to the old ways, maybe healers or dowsers generations back. 

Unlike the sheltered Elara, Lyra experienced the town's life outside the [[Priory of the Steadfast Light|Priory]] walls more directly. She lost her mother young to an illness the Priory couldn't heal, fostering a seed of doubt about the [[Eulogia|Eulogia's]] power or compassion. [[Ellara|Ellara]] first noticed the [[Spirit]] at this time but it was dormant for many years after.

She and Elara formed an unlikely childhood friendship – the observant Priory orphan and the slightly wilder town girl – perhaps meeting near the [[Highland Standing Stones|Standing Stones]], earning disapproval from [[Abbot Aris]]. 

As they grew older, their connection deepened into something rare and precious. During quiet evenings near the edge of the quarry, they would sit in companionable silence, watching the sunset cast amber light across the valley. In those moments of shared solitude, they found a wordless understanding that neither experienced with anyone else. Ellara would recite Eulogian poetry while Lyra listened intently, her eyes reflecting both curiosity and gentle skepticism about the verses' meanings.

Lyra kept a small notebook where she pressed flowers from their walks, marking each with dates and cryptic symbols that only she understood. Once, during the midsummer festival when Abbot Aris was occupied with rituals, they slipped away to the distant meadow where Lyra taught Ellara traditional folk dances, their laughter echoing across the fields as they spun beneath the open sky. Later, they lay side by side on the sweet grass, contemplating the vast starry expanse above, sharing dreams too fragile to voice anywhere else.

When they reached sixteen, Abbot Aris began noticing Ellara's distraction during prayers, the way her thoughts seemed to drift beyond the Priory walls. She assigned her additional scripture studies and meditation hours, scheduled precisely when Ellara would normally venture to the town edges. The separation created a hollow ache that neither girl had experienced before, leading to careful, deliberate ways to maintain their bond—coded messages in borrowed books, conversations disguised as chance encounters during market days, or quiet exchanges during herb gathering expeditions.

As time passed, Lyra became increasingly curious about the forbidden history and power associated with the stones and the ancestors, seeing them as a potential source of knowledge or agency denied by the strict Eulogian structure. She began cautiously exploring old rituals or seeking out elders who remembered more lore, putting herself at risk, especially after Aris's crackdown.

Ellara's transfer left an unspoken void in Lyra's life. The night before Ellara left, Lyra snukc into the [[Priory Layout|Priory garden]] and left a small bundle beneath Ellara's window—a handwoven bracelet of local fibers dyed with [[Sunstone|quarry minerals]], a small pouch of dried wildflowers from their meadow, and a folded note that simply read: "Find me in the light between worlds." Whether this referred to prayer, dreams, or something connected to the old ways remained intentionally ambiguous.

In the [[Capital|Capital]], Ellara sometimes wakes from dreams where Lyra stands amid the mist-shrouded [[Highland Standing Stones|Standing Stones]], calling to her from across an impossible distance. The bracelet remains hidden among her few possessions, a tangible reminder of a connection she cannot name but refuses to forget, wondering if Lyra too watches the same stars and remembers the understanding they shared without need for words.
