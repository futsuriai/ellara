Quori spirit stand-in mechanically, in world not sure what it is yet.

The Spirit may have a connection to the [[Highland Standing Stones|Highland Standing Stones]] that predate the arrival of the [[Eulogia|Eulogia]].

First manifestation was when [[Lyra Meadowlight]]'s mother died.

## Nature of the Spirit
The exact nature of Ellara's spirit is a mystery, even to her. It manifests as:
*   Profound empathy and intuition.
*   Occasional, uncontrolled bursts of spiritual energy, sometimes perceived as light, sometimes as a more unsettling, shadowy presence (especially during her first major manifestation).
*   A deep resonance with ancient places, particularly the [[Highland Standing Stones]] near [[Arkos]].

## Possible Interpretations (In-World Theories & Ellara's Fears/Hopes)
*   **A "Shadowed" Taint or Gift?:** Given the Eulogia's stance on "The Age of Shadow" and things "Shadowed" (like the initial view of Light Crystals), Ellara might fear her spirit is tainted or a dangerous throwback. Could her spirit be a manifestation of power from "The Age of Shadow," similar to the energy in Light Crystals, but perhaps in a more natural, personal, or uncontrolled form?
*   **Connection to "The Curse of the Shadowed"?:** Is her spirit related to the "Curse of the Shadowed" mentioned in ancient lore, or is it something that predates it, or is perhaps a form of resistance or counterbalance to it?
*   **An Echo of the Eternal Light?:** Alternatively, she might hope it's a purer, more direct connection to the Eternal Light, unmediated by standard Eulogian ritual, but manifesting in ways that are misunderstood.
*   **Ancestral Connection:** The spirit might be an inherited trait, a connection to ancestors from the Highlands who had similar abilities or ties to "The Age of Shadow."

Her experiences in [[Bastion City]], a hub of Light Crystal research and a place where the implications of "Shadowed" power are actively being debated, will force her to confront these questions more directly.
