# The Hariolar Empire

The Hariolar Empire is a vast and powerful domain, governed by an Emperor from the capital city of [[Pharos]]. The official religion of the Empire is the [[Eulogia]] of the Eternal Light, which plays a significant role in governance, culture, and daily life.

## Governance and Structure
The Empire is divided into provinces, such as [[Hieroterra]] and [[Ordonne]], each administered by a provincial governor and local authorities. While the Emperor holds ultimate authority, the Eulogia wields considerable influence, often intertwined with the Imperial bureaucracy.

## Religion and Culture
The Eulogia of the Eternal Light, centered on the worship of the divine Eternal Light and the teachings of its Saints (like Nites), is deeply ingrained in the fabric of Imperial society. It dictates moral codes, influences laws, and its temples and priests are present throughout the Empire. However, older traditions and beliefs sometimes persist in more remote regions, occasionally creating tension with official Eulogian doctrine.

## Recent Developments
The recent discovery of [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]] in Hieroterra has sent ripples throughout the Empire. This new technology promises significant advancements but also brings theological challenges due to its connection with "The Age of Shadow." The Empire is currently navigating the integration of this new power, with factions within both the Imperial court and the Eulogia debating its implications.

## Provinces of Note
*   **[[Ordonne]]:** The heartland province where the Imperial Capital, [[Pharos]], is located.
*   **[[Hieroterra]]:** A province rich in resources, now famous for the discovery of Light Crystals at the [[Sunstone Quarry]] near [[Arkos]]. Its provincial capital is [[Bastion City]].
