# Bastion City

Bastion City is the provincial capital of [[Hieroterra]] and has rapidly become the primary hub for [[Light Crystal]] research and technological development within the [[Hariolar Empire]]. 

## Overview
Located strategically within Hieroterra, Bastion City has seen significant growth and transformation since the discovery of Light Crystals. It is a bustling urban center, characterized by a blend of older provincial architecture and new structures built to support the burgeoning Light Crystal industry and research facilities.

## Key Features
*   **Light Crystal Research Headquarters:** The city hosts the main Imperial and Eulogian institutions dedicated to studying Light Crystals, their properties, and potential applications.
*   **Duskbreaker Lighthouse:** A prominent landmark, the Duskbreaker Lighthouse is said to be one of the first major constructions to be retrofitted or built using advanced Light Crystal technology, casting a powerful beam over the surrounding region.
*   **Prevalence of Light Crystal Technology:** Unlike more remote areas, Bastion City showcases the Light Crystal revolution. Streetlamps are powered by Light Crystals, public buildings utilize them for illumination and potentially other functions, and new industries related to their processing and application are emerging.
*   **Provincial Governance:** As the capital of Hieroterra, it houses the primary administrative offices for the province.

## Atmosphere
The city has a dynamic and somewhat tense atmosphere. It's a place of innovation and opportunity but also one where the implications of Light Crystal technology – and its controversial "Shadowed" origins – are constantly debated and felt. There's a notable presence of Imperial officials, Eulogian scholars, engineers, and merchants, all drawn by the promise of this new resource. For someone like [[Ellara]], arriving from a remote town like [[Arkos]], Bastion City would be an overwhelming experience of new technologies, diverse populations, and complex social and theological currents.
