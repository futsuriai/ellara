# Hieroterra Province

Hieroterra is an Imperial Province of the [[Hariolar Empire]], known for its rugged terrain, particularly the [[Highlands]] region, and its significant mineral resources, including [[Sunstone]] and the recently discovered [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]]. The provincial capital is [[Bastion City]].

## Geography
The province is characterized by a mix of rocky highlands, forests, and fertile river valleys. The [[Highlands]] are remote and sparsely populated, home to towns like [[Arkos]]. The [[Sunstone Quarry]] near Arkos is a site of major economic and strategic importance.

## Culture and Economy
Historically, Hieroterra has been somewhat insular, with local traditions and beliefs holding strong, sometimes in tension with the doctrines of the [[Eulogia]]. The economy was traditionally based on agriculture, mining (especially Sunstone), and local crafts. The discovery of Light Crystals has brought significant changes, with increased Imperial presence and investment, particularly around Bastion City and the Sunstone Quarry. This has led to economic growth but also social and cultural shifts.

## Strategic Importance
With the advent of Light Crystal technology, Hieroterra's strategic importance to the Empire has massively increased. It is now at the forefront of a technological revolution, drawing attention from both Imperial authorities and the Eulogian church, who are keen to control and understand the potent new resource and its connection to "The Age of Shadow."
