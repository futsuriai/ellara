# Light Crystals

Discovered in 643 AE deep within the [[Sunstone Quarry]] near [[Arkos]] in the province of [[Hieroterra]], Light Crystals are potent sources of illumination and energy. Their discovery was concurrent with finding ancient artifacts, including "Standing Stones," identified as relics from "The Age of Shadow."

## Properties and Technology
Light Crystals emit a steady, bright light and can be harnessed for various technological applications, from streetlamps to more complex devices. Their energy is potent and has quickly become a valuable resource for the [[Hariolar Empire]].

## Theological Controversy and Acceptance
The origin of Light Crystals, found alongside artifacts of "The Age of Shadow," initially led the [[Eulogia]] to condemn them as "blasphemous" and connected to the "Shadowed"â€”entities or curses from that dark period. Many feared their power was inherently corrupting.

However, the undeniable utility and potential of Light Crystals prompted a theological re-evaluation. The Eulogia eventually declared that the crystals, though found in places touched by shadow, could be sanctified and used as a "means of repent for the Shadowed," effectively a way to bring light from darkness and turn ancient, potentially dangerous power to the service of the Eternal Light and the Empire. This stance, while official, remains a subject of debate and unease among some faithful.

## Imperial Interest
The discovery has significantly increased Imperial interest in regions like Hieroterra, particularly the Sunstone Quarry, now a site of strategic importance for both its traditional [[Sunstone]] and the newly found Light Crystals.
