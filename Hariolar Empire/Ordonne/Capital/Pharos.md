The city is renowned for its magnificent architecture, grand temples, libraries, and academies. It is the theological, doctrinal, and administrative heart of the Eulogia.

## Key Features
*   **The Imperial Palace:** Residence of the Emperor and center of Imperial governance.

*   **Eulogian Archives and Academies:** Pharos houses the most extensive church archives and the most prestigious theological academies in the Empire. Decisions regarding doctrine, such as the official stance on [[Light Crystal|Light Crystals]], would be debated and issued from here.

## Significance for Ellara
For someone like [[Ellara]], Pharos would represent the ultimate center of her faith and the Empire's power. If she were to pursue "advanced theological study" at the highest level, or if her unique abilities drew the attention of the Eulogia's senior leadership, Pharos is where she might eventually be summoned or aspire to go. It stands in contrast to [[Bastion City]], which is a center of new technology and provincial administration; Pharos is the center of established tradition and ultimate authority.
