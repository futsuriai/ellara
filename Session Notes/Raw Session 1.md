We open... 
It is the year 651 AE (After Eulogia). We are in the Hariolar Empire, Hieroterra province, an eastern province ruled by Duke Valerian Oleander. Often seen as the most backwater, the reach of the Eulogia has not reached as far as in other provinces. Devotion is not as strong. High population of the "shadowed". Gleaming capital is bastion city, which sits on either side of a canal. It cuts the city in half, east/west, west is grand with the ducal palace, edifice to the eulogian, the aristocracy. The east has the duskbreaker lighthouse, research center on light crystals. We can see lamps have been replaced by new light crystal lamps. One of the first inventions of the lighthouse. The east side is a bit more slummy/more shadowed people. These are humanoids / a bit different / more fey than most, but here we find the streets still lined (at least the main ones) with these crystal lamps. Farther from the lighthouse it's less glorious, less rich, more simple homes, more utilitarian. More gravel, less paved compared to West of the City. East also leads into the more "untamed" parts of the province. 

Today is a bright day, day of alms giving. Eulogian members giving out food and necessities. Food is open to anyone, in the west it might be more luxurious. East more modest. 

5 story building, nothing special. Inside we find someone, he's holding a letter. The letters just show up, he doesn't know how. They're clever, sneaky (the letter holder). From a dear friend that her daughter should show up and to help her.

Nyx: Dark elf, gloomstalker. Physically, if you played Dishonored like Corvo. 6ft, looks like player. Darkish skin. Crossbow master.  He lives in a pied de terre, a bit rustic, he likes nature. Darker side of nature. A little goth-y but nice. He's been in the city for a while. He's comfortable, but not ostentatious. Homey. Not big. 2 bedroom. 

Not too far, subject of the letter:

She has an address to go to, a necklace from her mother.

Tsi'nyra: A "normal" human. Average height, 5'6''ish, long black hair, east asian features. She has a leopard companion. Sometimes if close enough you might see a small spider crawling across her features. Her first time away from home, in a big city. Her family is her purpose. Sometimes seems to have wisdom beyond her years. Balances against not knowing "basic" things.

Nyx/Nyra meeting: knock. Nyx offers basic amenities, drinks, how was your journey, he introduces himself as a friend of her mother's. Wants to introduce her to the city.
-Nyra: stressful, she feels lost. mother sent me but two of her older siblings are missing. We need to find them.

Zoom out:

Alms day, more people out than normal. Still in eastern side. Outside of "church (name tbd)", find a devotee of the faith handing out food.

Ellara: 20s, red hair in braid, grey eyes. True believer grew up in a small town in a priory. Trying to learn the locals as she hands out food. She's been here a few times. Lives at the church in a residence, has hometown mementos and still in constant contact. Getting used to a big city still.

Zoom out:

Shorter stature, halfling, been in the city for a while. He knows it's a good day to get food and supplies, all you have to do is show up.

Berridin: small halfling, 3 feet, slipping through the crowd, only seen when he wants to be seen. Quick to a smile if inwardly hesitant. South asian features. Radiant gold strip of hair. It looks out of place.

Ellara+Berridin: she remembers his hair. he tries to palm a bread. it falls it hits a foot. The last of the party.

New comer to the city arrives. Ysidor.

Ysidor: 7'6'' foot goliath. Towering over most. Grey skinned. Crackles along the skin that sort of mimic granite in white. medium length hair in a short ponytail. Jade pendant. on his hip a war pick (hammer), and a pitchfork on his back. Cropped leather top, sleeveless. Medium length kilt. From a backwards village. He's stunned by the light. He hasn't eaten in a while so he gave away all his money to beggars.

Ellara+Berridin+Ysidor: 
Ysidor: yells very loudly if someone dropped their bread
Berridin: here, here! *shocked by the size of Ysidor*
Ysidor: asks if he lost this, young one
Ellara: that's not his bread
ends up giving it to Ysidor

Nyx/Nyra walking around and see this.

nyra: what's that??
nyx: that's a goliath, be friendly, respectful, keep your distance, usually gentle don't fuck with them, are you good with eating?
nyra: i can eat food.

they come up to get food:

ellara gives bread
nyx thanks, my friend is here
leopard is there.
Ysidor screams: kitty and decides to pet it
nyx intervenes to help
ellara tries to usher them out because they're disturbing the distribution
takes them to a back courtyard

ellara gets the feeling that this is maybe what the eternal light wants her to do. the light IS testing her she feels. it's that familiar feeling she knows from where it is. they need help.

berridin has ysidor lift him up
nyra: why are you so small, is that good

they can pet cat

berridin might have heard of nyx
berridin: "you might have heard of me"
nyx: "your name?"
berridin: "berridin the bold" /s

ysidor: "are you known in the city, have you lived here for a while"
nyx: "i have a bit of a reputation, i would know what's happening in the city"
ysidor: pulls out charcoal drawing, basically a stick figure. "i came looking for my mentor, have you seen her"
nyx: "what race are they?"
ysidor: points at the picture, she's meri, she was here a month or two ago

berridin: when you spotted big guy, you noticed the grain of familiarity, you've seen someone like that stick out, more recently saw them, rumor someone came to the city, guards got injured? don't know details. 
ellara (nat 20): remember the shadowed. you may not know names. the voice told her it's important. "there was one... " two alms givings ago, you saw a similar goliath, very respectful. Lost in a different way than ysidor. More new but more commanding way. There was an issue with the guards and a goliath, but the one she saw was so polite. She was described as very ferocious, took down 20 guards and was arrested.  Clergy was just like "that's the shadowed for you, can't trust them". Accusations that were quickly dismissed. Something was said during the incident about accusing the duskbreaker lighthouse.

she describes her to ysildor and describes what she knows.

ysildor: can you bring me to the arrestation station.

ellara: maybe not the best idea to go in person, let's see if we can send a message.

ysildor: ok, i trust you

ellara: struggling to figure out how to house him

berridin: i offer a place (but its' cramped because it's fro halflings), nyx?

nyx: i-it's under renovations.

berridin: catches the lie. they'll g

berridin/ellara exchange eulogian blessings

ysidor: may hyr bless all of you.

ellara: be careful with those words (heresies), much to teach you (chance to teach to eulogia), let's meet back in 2 days.

------ 

light crystals start turing on, ysidor is mind boggled. "did they pluck stars from the sky"
nyra: "have you harnessed bioluminescence as well"
nyx: "new technology, harnessed by the duskbreaker lighthouse, refined crystal that holds/emits magical energy"
ysidor: touches one and is amazed.

ellara goes back to get leftover food hands it to ysidor:
ellara: may this bring you closer to the light
ysidor: i hope so too (thinking it means normal lights)
ellara: great! (excited to convert)
ellara takes a carriage back.

----
they split into two groups:

nyx: hows the mothertree
nyra: bond with kin hasn't triggered. she knows her missing siblings are not here or haven't gotten close.
nyx: so the agents of the mothertree haven't reported anything?
nyra: not really
nyx: then we must find more allies, let me see what i can do

---

berridin: it's this way
they go to the halfings residential area, ysidor is HUGE inside it
berridin: hey big guy, can you take a few bites out of that loaf, we might not have enough after the young ones come out.
halfling children come out.  they are like a foot and a half tall they're climbing on top of the new giant
berridin: look who i brought!
trea don't give them candy
berridin: this is all healthy food!
kids: "uncle berridin, let's play"
berridin: motions to ysidor, "your people fart right"
ysidor: i-i do
berrdin: casts minor illusion to generate a fart cloud, in the rush they walk away from the kids, checks in on his neighbour because ysidor will be stomping. another reference to the "candy incident of 650". 

----

ellara: goes to denmother to ask about a goliath.
denmother: surely they were arrested, eastern prisons, i would assume she's there.
ellara: can you help with some info / get information
denmother: i'll try
denmother: good of you to be here in city after being outside of the gaze of the light
ellara: i belive the priory is within the light

ellara goes home and writes a letter to her friend for home.

------ 

nyx/nyra:

nyx; don't tell anyone where i live, keep our info secret
nyra: mum's the word

nyra is fascinated by the food and what there is to eat, leopard also eating. fidgeting with things she's never seen like plumbing.

--- 

nyx decided to go to a watering hole for info in a shadier area where people don't ask as many questions.

nyx: any info on my folk missing?
bar: not really
nyx: if you can, keep an ear out
bar: "there's a young guard captain, maybe luck hasn't been with him"

nyx gets dealt into a game
abysmal hand
"luck is not on my side tonight"

eventually
"i have some friends saying ppl are missing"
guard: we always get that
"this is different"
guard: like that goliath two months ago?
"yeah, that sort of thing"
guard: no i wasn't there.. you should have seen them... took out 20... saw some, they were beat up pretty bad... they had her in eastern prison... so weird, we had to move her to one of the western prisons.
he throws up and stops talking there
