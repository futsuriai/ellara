when ellara enters dorm nice envelope with my name on it
"dear ellara, given your recent intererst in the duskbreaker lighthouse and that you met director reeves, i have been invited to the ball in two days in the grand duke's palace. you can further see how eulogia interacts with the nobility etc and understand the politics etc, (a bit more formally written in larger)

sincerly proctor eduouard"

she sends a message to the group via the sending to tell them she got invited by the proctor. 

she writes a letter to her friend at home telling her about what's been happening. 

nyx goes to the golden goose to book a room
12 int: he realizes he needs a few days around the ball.
"i need to book a room for 5 days" 
"20 gold for 5 nights, sir"
nyx pauses looking at his 5 gold.
nyx: "what's the rate per night?"
"5 gold per night"
n:"i'll take it for one night"
"oh though you only need a 5 gold deposit for your full stay plus a deposit of course"
n: he moves to hand over the sickle
"oh so crude, why are you handing me a gardner's tool"
n: "i travel ligh,t this is very sentimental"
"hmm, ok... " they hand over a key "it's the floor above"
it's an elegant but spartan room.

he sending stones/communicates to the group
"i'll be honest, i got a room but i don't have enough money at the moment."

---

next day opens elsewhere.

a sleeping character, someone new. Witty is having a dream. he's never had a nightmare in his life. every night he dreams of puppies and flowers and being one with the animals and birds.

he gets out of bed in a nice west side place. in a silken gown. he reaches to the side expecting a fresh cup of tea. but there's not. he's a little out of sorts then remembers his manservant hasn't been around lately so he has to make his own. so he goes to do that, burns himself since he's not used to it. as he's going around, the front door for the mail. he sees a little envelope. he gets a smile "ohh mail, how quaint", he takes it. he uses a letter opener to elegantly open it. it says

"dear lord whitaker, you are cordially invited to the grand soiree at the duke's palac in 2 days forth" very flowery/calligraphic wit ha seal. whittaker woos and spins and says "i finally get a chance to wear my nicest suit and maybe this is when i finally get to rub elbows with people at the lighthouse! and get to meet more nobility in bastion city". 

He realizes he needs to prepare to impress. he doesn't know where his manservant is. he needs to press his laundry but has no idea how to. his manservant being a halfing he thinks he should find him in the halfing enclave.

on his way he admires the lighthouse and he's in awe, it's his dream to be a scientist of that caliber.
---
berridin wakes up from his usual nightmares. iron. steel. fire. smoke in his lungs. "i can never see their faces.."

he wakes up and tells ysidor "i think we need to hook up with nyx at his room"
ysidor: "yeah he sounds like he's in a nice place"
they are in nyx's current house, no the hotel.
berridin looks around to see if there's something valuable that's not cursed, perception 19. 
it's a crystal serpent, with a golden inlay. gems for eyes. gold and silver in the inlay.
berriding goes to examine it.  he ponders about swiping it but decides he's a hero now.
he talks to nyx (at the hotel) via sending stone. he mentions pawning something for money.
berrdin puts it back for now. 
"i do see this figurine"
nyx: "the snake? that's perfect, yeah yeah yeah, i love that thing but do what you got a do"
berrdin: what's the story for this object?
nyx "let's make up a story, i got it after my first big job but i don't really want to get into it" but instead they decide to raid his caches of stored money. nyx mentions a small cache of funds. and tells berridin about his "small" cache.
sleight of hand + help adv: 14, so berridins opens the cache.
d100+5 is how much gold he finds. 82 gold. in the small cache.
berridin: "yeah i just grabbed 50 gold"
nyx: "berridin, i know that since we met, you wanted to pilfer stuff from my place ok. i know exactly how much is in that smallest of my caches. grab 10 gold it's yours. bring the rest. i know how much is in there. i will kill you if you steal more. and my trust."
he pats the figure on the way out.

deception 16: he makes a nobleman disguise for ysidor.  
he creates a different disguise for himself but still uses the name Calvin Valespire as he hadn't uttered it when the previous disguise is lost. average sized human.
perception check on leaving: berridin: 12, ysidor: 1. 
berridin sees a nobleman who, not quite disheveled, but clothing could be crisper that's a bit lost.
witty perception: 11. he doesn't feel but a kid swipes something out of your pocket. a small trinket.
berrdini sees an obvious aristocrat on the eastern side, not near the lighthouse, it sticks out. and he noitces the kid stealing the trinket.
berridin walks closer. to ysidor "let's walk like the nobles" (he's in a poor person's impression of a nobleman, berridin is)
he approaches witty, does a once over. 
witty thinks "wow, what a dapper gentelman" he loves the style
"you look a little lost there, fella", berridin
w: "i am, i seem to have gotten turned around"
b: "why, i actually have a very special relationship with them, what do you need"
w: looking for my manservant, perhaps he went to visit his family
b: it's not like we al-- they all live in the same place, they have separate homes there
b: what's his name?
w: jarvis, he came from my family's in my family's estate in vassilia but he disappeared a few days ago. do you know him.
b: history check 5. - he hasn't heard much but he also hasn't been around much there. "you know, i'm usually up to date, somewhat of a leader tehre, i have not heard of this jarvis. doesn't even sound like a halfing name to be honest"
w: well you know, the halfings in my estate tend to take the names of normal people
b: cough cough - this man servant, is he a paid employee of yours?
w: we've never discussed the monetary part of our relationship, he always gets what he needs.. i'm worried for him, i'm preparing for this ball and really need him.
b: i'm sorry that he doesn't seem to be around, maybe he doesn't want to be found? did he leave a note?
w: nonesene he loves me and i love him. as a leader and a followr, a man and his servant. 
b: insight check 5 - that seems normal. he seems sincere. nobility from what he knows have a close relationship with their working staff. "i'll tell you what, what was your name again?"
w: lord whitaker the 6th, but friends call me witty
b: he says his name calvin valespire, "lt me help find him"
w: thank you maybe you can help find someone else to cover?
b: i-i just think they're not that repleaceable, i tohught you had a bond.
w: well things happen, i go with the wind
b: are you going to the duke's ball?
w: i was invited to the ducal ball, you are probabl/y going too with that attire right?
b: of course, if you must know i'm one of the finest tailors in the city
w: you must be quite a successful tailor if you're being invited to the ball? you're making the clothes and attending yourself?
b: you know we've really cornered the market here. our ceo has.. i may have told you too much.
w: do you work with purple? i'm thinking all purple.
b - casts prestidigiation to clean his clothes.all wrinkles disappear. then a thin purple piece around his neck "i think purple would work"
b: "come to my spot, it's a little place on this side of the city, it's nice for this part of the city"
w: "you can make me my suit now?"
b: we'll get you fixed you, then we'll go to the west side to meet up with our colleagues at one of the ritzy places, i'm sure you could afford to stay there with us.
w: did you sy we're going to a hotel?
b: don't worry if you forgot your money bag, we can spot you.
w: oh i do love hotel parties, can make messes i couldn' at home.

ellara morning prayers etc. 

finds proctor eduourd at his office
"ellara, i assume you're here about the ball"
"of course, i'm so honored, what do i need to wear or prepare"
"you will not be expected to dress like nobility, clean eulogian garb "
ellara worried i'll do the wrong thing with nobility/say 
him: tehy'll be forgiving as my guest, etc, just be courteous. this is an opportunity to see.
ellara: is there anythin gi should study, i'm so unprepared. 
hmi: there's a book check with denmother. but really this is a learning opportunity.  for your curiousity of the light house. 
ellara: ok so study the book and manners. got it
he smiles
el: how do we get there
we will go via carriage 
ellara; is anyone else going from the seminary
him: no, jsut us, most will be from the ducal invite list. maybe visit merchants. we will be the most "common" among them.
ellara o-oh no pressure. i could have never imagined this back when i lived in arkos.
him: they are not that different, just more money and they like to show it.

she goes to find the denmother, and tells her about tihs.
denmother comes out with an olde tome, dated and dusty. "oh yes court manners of the nobility" been a while. "i don't know how useful it'll be "
ellara do you have any advice
denmother: stay away from them, they are hedonists.
but the nobility should have the strongest connection
denmother: the older the tree, the old roots wither.
thank you i must be off to study. 

she wants to lock in and study.

back at nyx's:
b: tell me, witty, what's your --
w: Lord witty.
b: what's your favorite outfit, lord witty
w: tall top hat, suede or velvet. a long sweeping coat. a vest a 3 piece with a bowtie. a small cane. and glass vials with different colored vials.
*in the distance a boom*
b: did you want purple?
w: everything.
b: alright... -he uses the disguise kit+disguise self on others- and turns him into the purple tuxedo with a tophat vision.  with a comically small cane. 
witty wisdom save 2. doesn't notice at all it's an illusion.
b: great powers of perception, sir.
w: just twirilng his cane excitedly, not even listening.
b: gets in front. 'how does it look'
w: it looks wonderful good sir, have you thought about being a manservant.
b: i have not. i am kind of offenedd you event ask that after this art creation, but before we go. i can't let you go without telling you this, my apparel is based in illusion magic, are you familiar with magic.
w: yes, what do you mean it's an illusion it looks realy.
b: i know sir, *holds up right sleeve and shows him going through the fabric" if someone touches you the illuesion won't hold
w: sire have you able to shift through planes how are you doing this magic
b: this is a form of magic, illusion based
w: is that like.. shadowed? 
b: sometimes if you're pushing the realms of what is possible... this is my own science.
w: i understand, i too have dabbled in new things. (another explosion goes off in the distance)
b: are those your explosions
w: who can say... (he checks around notices some of his vials are missing but he just shrugs silently)
w: well this is perfect because i wont' have to wash or clean this, especially sicne you're turning down my offer.
w: can i pay you?
b: yes, of course, that'll be 10 gold
w: wow that's so affordable.
b: y-yes. i guess i can' go back.
w gives him 12.

b: tells nyx via sending stone they are coming over to bring the gold.
---
nyx perception: 19. he noticeds the 3 strangers in the lobby. he notices the tell tale gold in the hair.
nyx just looks affluent. 
b: "alexander it's kal'din, your good buddy."
nyx points at the gold hair: that buddy?
nyx to ysidor who is caribou but nyx doesn't know... : e-elk?
w: i prefer vension.
nyx: oh i'm alexander. 
w: i'm whitaker.
nyx: i see this is the new friend you mentioned?
b: he got invited to the ducal ball and i assumed we could bring him along for a consult. 
w: i've been very impresesd by this man's seweing skills.
nyx reaches out thinking it's a disguise and the hand goes through the sleeve. he looks a berridin an smirks but says nothing. 
b: it's pretty good right
w: can you feel how smooth this is, it's so light.
n: let's go to the room.
--
knock on the door a bit after getting there.
nyx checks who it is, it's staff.
"mr alexander."
nyx tells ppl to hide and not be visible.
he steps out to speak directly to the staff w/o opening the door uflly.
"we received a missive for you, here it is" hands over an envelope.
n: "ok i just got the letter which is why i got the room", looks at everyone and whitaker. "berridin, you did this disguise? are we cool?""
w: hello alexander, i am lord whitaker the 6th. 
n: truly? lord whitaker the 6th or... lord whitaker the 6th(with a wink)
w winks back. 
w: i'm here to start a school, wanted to recruit some students, i experiment with gases. i hope to rival even even the light house, the instute of filosophical neumatics, the ifn, you've probably heard of it.
n to b: if this guis is telling the truth... this guy has no idea. 
b to n: this guy has an inivte, i have a good feeling.
they roll stealth against w's perception, nyx 12. berridin 19. whitaker 15 perception. he overhears nyx about the "do you trust him" but not the responses.
wh: can i prove to you what i can do? 
n: oh i believe in what you can do. 
w: my biggest dream is to be noticed by the lighthouse. i want an interview with director faberege, that's my main goal here. i think kal'din's support as my new manserveant i could defintiely get that attention under my idol.
b: as luck would have it i'm intimately familar with her, you could say i've occupied the same spaces as her.
wh: you truly are.
b: off the top of my head woul/d you support an evil org sucking the lifeforce out of organisms even if they are shadowed.
w: that sounds quite uncouth.
b: see nyx?
n looks at berridin: i'm going to trust you, and you vouch for him. but this is on you.
n: welcome aboard lord whitaker. 
wh: i've never heard nyx as a short name for alexander.
n: a bit of precaution, my stage name is alexander. my friends call me nyx. 
wh: i hope that i too can call you that, in public though use alexander. 
n: are you truly whitaker. 
wh: yes and giddy for i have never had friends.
--
ellara knocks on the door
nyx: oh come in
ellara oh thank you, master nyx.
nyx: we have a new firend, this is lord whitaker.
whitaker: call me lord witty
nyx: berridin, he always has the gold thing that's how you know
b: i go by many names but you can typically call me by din.
n: see we all got stage names.
wh: will we be a travelling troupe.
n: w're on a great mission. we're learning about you, you're learning about us. you make a decision. tell us more about yourself, about this school.
wh: daunting. this is the craziest hotel party i've been to.
wh: i'm lord whitaker the 6th, as the 6th son of lord whitaker of and inland provice of vasilia, in the county cork.   my older brother's whitaker the 1st and 2nd went to torchlight, and the 3rd... i'd rather not talk about him. 4th and 5th, well the 5th joined the clergy. and the 4th is a traveler. he's exploring boaden. taht leaves me, the 6th, my parents didn't let me out much. some may say, embarassement, i choose to say misunderstood. and my older brothers. loving brothers as they called me witty due to me aweareness and high intellect. i've worked hard to be where i am. and i tihnk anyone relaly could accopmlsih what i've accomplished.
b: so your name, you go by witty, but that was bestowed not due to your name but your wit?
wh: yes, in every situation i just think to myself what would a genious do and i just do that. my first taste of success came at a young age experimenting with these gases, i made this gas that i call the success gas. everyday i have a little bit of it, i call it intelligence in a bottle. 
nyx: tell me more about these gases
b: the success gas is a mixture of snake venom and the anal glands of the sphinx, turns out gassifying it it becomes inert  and there's no negative consequencies. it brings success and confidence. want to try some?
nyx holds berridn back for a second.
ysidor: i think an adult should try it before...
wh: i would not think he is a child..
ysidor: they do grow up fast.
nyx: nature 16. he knows it's not poisonous and that he'd have a good time.
nyx throws his hands out: alright, we have the party. i have the envelope. i don't want anyone taking anything. until after the party <taking out his crosswbow>
b: ok... totally, i promisee
nyx: i know this works, i know this is fine for you witty but we need reliability for tomorrow.
wh: no no this is pure success in a bottle.  no age limit. 
b: i don't like to toot my own horn but i have a high resistance to alcohol.
nyx: pushes him back. 
wh while that happens, he pulls out his inhaler blue swirling things and takes a hit and hands it over to ysidor. "i assure you i'm perfectly sober"
ysidor: well i've been bitten by snakes before and i'm fine. he takes a big hit. <con save throw, dc 13, he rolls 5> <ysidor starts seeing light, for the next 4 hours, disadvantage on light rolls>
berridin sleightt of havnd 10 vs nyx 9, and berridin takes a whiff too, con save 12. same effect. 

wh: you want to see the eternal light.
nyx gets between and sys none for her.
ellara: i can handle myself. i am sos disappointed in you thre.e. clarify of mind is how you find the light, not clouding your eyes.
ysidor points at nothing saying he sees the light there.
e: the shadows love to deceive by seeming like light
b to ysidor: casts shower of sparks. "bro check this out"

ellara: master nyx, i did not expect much but i did expect better.
nyx: do you want to look at the letter i got.
ellara sure.
the letter is short and neat: "master alexander, i recieved notice from y ever concerned neighbour jacinta about your services, i won't be able to for the ball but if you are around after i would love to see your wares."
nyx: at least i wont' have to pretend to be a tailor.

wh: so you're not a tailor?
nyx; it's part of my persona stage character.

nyx to ellara: did you hear any news?
ellara: did you also have some of the substance.. i told everyone i did get an invite...

ellara: i am concerned with being the only one there besides this... lord whitaker.
whitaker: have you tried smiling ellara.
ellara: i do not know how you found this... man
nyx: can you get me in to the party.
the invite was to the household.
wh: whitaker the 4th is in the wilderness, perhaps you could impersonate him. and you also look light on your feet to be a dance partner if you would like.
nyx: we would like to get veryone in... do you have sisters?
wh: well my father only allowed males to stay in the household. 
nyx what about ysidor, what can we do for our friend here.  (he's throwing berridin up and down in the air)
wh casts featherfall on him to slow his descent. 
wh: you know what, caribou looks quite like whitaker the 4th there. 
-----
ellara goes back to study knowing everyone else is useless.
witty goes ack to prepare gases but nivites berridin to use his manservants quarters,
w: when my manservant left a good portion of my warddrobe disapperad at the same time.
w: i do have more success gas, what follows is more success.
b does go with him
ysidor follows his buddy. 
b: con save 16 on another hit of the gas, so no effect
---
nyx checking another stash - luck check want 95 or higher: 79. nyx realizes one of the reasons in the stash berridin had, you realize you forgot to put it into a more secure stash so there's not as much as you expect here. 30 gold.
---
ellara meets up with proctor eduoard, in his proctor outfit. 
sister ellara did you enjoy your study
yes it came it quite handy, thank you for the suggestion
he motions for her to enter the carriage first
ed: i know you're neverous, you may hear rumours, some say due to donathan reevse visiting but her lady Ophelia Xanteres Oliander. the marchionesso f bastion city. the niece of the oleandar and his heir. she has returned from torchlight college. it's to celebrate her return. 
ell: oh, it'll be somewhat comforting to have someone around my own age even if the social stature is a world apart. 
eduouord: she's a great lady and very devout
ella beams and claps, that's great to hear that the dukedom will be in good hands, some nobles are far from the light. i do hope i get to speak with her. 
eduouad: you'll be introduced with me, 

getting close it's the first time seeing the castle from so up close there seems and she's agog. he gentlemanly escorts her out of the carriage.

they are guided to inside. art deco, opulence. vaulted ceilings. straight lines. super detailed. harsh in a way. light crystals everywhere. 

"proctor eduoard of the eulogian church and sister ellara" someone announces as they go in. every different color, the men are in high collared sutis, with tails, pants, etc, and proctor eduourd leads you to a gentelman, tall salt+pepper, besides donathan reeves in blues, between a young lady in crimson, with feather detailing that goes out as you approach.

proctor bows deeply "your grace, grand duke of hieroterra" "your most honerable marchioness" and "your honorable viscount" may i present sister ellara

she repeats the address saying it's an honor.

the salt and pepper man in a low voice "well met sister ellara, the proctor has been in forming us of your curiousity with the light house and eulogian relationships as much as it is to honor my niece's return"

"oh uncle it's such a wonderful party and a fellow eulogian my you walk in the light"

ellara reacts and my the light find you as well

"oh it's nice to be home, pharos is great but nothing like home, and uncle donnothan made "
donnathan "nice to see you again sister ellara, i hope you enjoy the night"
ophelia "yes yes, i apologize if everything seems a bit hasty, donnathan really wanted this to happen quickly, i just returned i  was delayed a bit, uncle i did see there was the army did cause some delays in some mining town but maybe i souhd not mention that but it is"
ellara looks at the proctor worriedly
proctor "oh you are familiar with the incident, the incident with the shadowed village and the mines"
ellara: oh yes the stone goliath that you freed. we must teach the shadowed to bring them closer to the light.
ophelia: yes yes we must bring them to the light and i'm sorry for bringing up such a heavy topic, sorry i do have to speak to the other guests
---
party house @ witty's
ysidor got an estate room
berridin got the manservant's chambers
at some point his disguise must have faded, now he's a halfing. ysidor is 7 feet tall.
"oh jarvis you're here"
b: "witty, do we all look alike to you"
w: is that not true..?
b: i don't even think jarvis looks like me
w: well you could have gotten work done, you'd mentioned not liking your nose
b: ok, how do i explain this. 
w: wait wait, can we do this over some steaks, can we order some food.
b: look look i'm not gonna cook because you want to, but, also i don't like manservant, it should be halfling servant, wait i don't like servant. 
w: oh i do like ethnic food.
sleight of check to cook: 20 (dirty). he's making a spicy spicy food. and rice. the food is technically perfect.
w eats this incredibly spicy curry. and every bite coughing "jarvis you learned some new techniques"
b: witty, you understand that i am not your halfing servant right
w: que sera sera. 
b: if i was a servant, what would my daily stipend be.
w: whatever you need is what you need, it's mutual dependency.
b is considering this: just don't call me manservant. slide me a number.
b 20 gold? woud that be good as an advance
w: will i haven't gotten money from the fam in a bit. so can we work something out for now and i'll owe you?
b holds out his hand.
w gives him the gold.
w mentions his feet are sore and need a massage
nyx arrives
n: "hello lord witt"y", then goes to berridin, "my money"
b gives him 50 gold.
n shakes his head
b gives 10 more.
n: 72 gold. in my hand. now.
b counts 10 more, "is that enough"
n: 2.
b flips two more.
n "thank you" leaning in close "never short change me again"
nyx makes himself comfortable after asking. 
white has no scks and recahse out to berridin as if asking ofr the massage.

whitaker 1: heir, 2 went to torchlight. 3... no ifno yet, 4 the explorer, 5 the eulogian.

color scheme: 
1 red, 2 blue, 3 was orange, 4 was brown which helps in his exploring. 5 was yellow. (6 is purple)

side note: eulogians wear navy/white
they are deciding who goes as which brother.
so probably nyx 3, ysidor 4, and berridin 5. 

wh: a long time ago there was an incident at a different ball, 3 was never seen again after. it involved a viscount's daughter. that's all i know.
nyx: if you were me, who'd you go as. 
wh: i'd say wh 4th. you resemble his build.
so maybe berridin number 3, ysidor number 5. 
berridin/nyx using disguise self berridin disguise self on ysidor.
wh suggests the most opulent carriage. orederd a bit last minute so it's a bit late. 

driver "lord whitaker, our services are 10 gold for the eventing."
wh " no problem my man servant will take care of it."
d "did you mean your eldest brother would pay"
wh "yes eyes of course, the third"
b reluctantly gives 10 gold.

it's opulent soft, grleta pillows. they get there they show the invite. 

"the lords whitaker whitman, which ones are present"
"3 through 6"

"the lord whitaker whitmas 3rd 4th 5th and 6th" are annoucement

ellara hears this, it's later in the evening. 

they go to introduce themselves to the host, the grand duke. 

wh bows deeply "thank you so much, your grace grand duke of hieroterra your grace, may i introduce my older siblings"

donnathan "whitman... whitakers, it's been a while, that orange.. we thought you died after that incident"

b mutters "he didn't catch me, i had to lay low for a while"

donnatahN: i didn't realize you would take that dare all the way

b somethimes you have to challenge yourself

donna; i had heard witty came, surprised you are all here, i guess to keep him company
n: pats him on the shoulder: yes.
donna: we will be seeing you areounhd, oleandar darling, i did grow up with some of the older siblings i should tell you the time teh eldest and i dared the 3rd to... well i shouldn't say in polite company.  

and they dismiss them.
