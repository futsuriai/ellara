proctor eduard introduced ellara to people in a get to know ppl kind of way

witty decides he's gonna go dance. performance check:  6 (nat 1). runs into others, steps on feet. he is unaware of his awkwardness but he's enjoying it.

nyx as nature boy (whittaker 4). to the side. brooding.

berridin as mysterious brother 3: perception check: 11 (checking if anyone is interested in him). insight 5. din is taking on what he imagines the brother to be, he thinks the brother is hot shit and everyone is interested. he runs his orange hair through with his hand, 80s movie style. he hovers around groups trying to ovehear "oh yes yes baron so and so, did you hear he this and that" etc or business talk or "oh yes, ophelia looks soo stunning, wonder how things will change now that she's back from college". he looks for her investigation: 13 - he sees her across the dance floor on the other side, still moving between the crowds on her own. he weaves towards her dancing "subtly" performance dirty 20, he does blend in. full on peacocking towards ophelia. persusasion 23. close to her now. 

ysidor as the 5th brother, the "eulogian". perception 9. can't quite find if there's other eulogians. he does know ellara would be there. there's also food being served. he notices pigs in a blanket. servant offers him some. he grabs the entire plate. "thank you, young sir" and walks away and eats them all. the servant just looks and walks away. there's also trays with different alcohol/liquids. he starts grabbing different glasses and collecting. charisma check: 4. he's standing out like a sore thumb. 

ellara asks proctor eduoard about the brother causing a hubbub. "i do not recognize him, he is wearing... i do wonder how he got here... if you give me a moment" he gets the tea "apparently he is from a noble family... i was not aware of that, we should introduce".  she nods.

ysidor sees salt/pepper slicked back hair, fine robes, approach with ellara.

eduoard: "brother, i believe it's... brother whitaker i take it? the Vth?"
ysidor mouth full of food, wipidng his hand on his robe: I do well sir, how do you?
ellara: i find it so humbling a person from a noble life would choose this option with all the other options available.
ysidor: humbleness is the key to salvation as they say. persuasion w/ disadvantage: 15
ed: yes yse, i don't know if you're aware but i too come from an elated background. there is nobility to choose this path. I am proctor eduard, in charge of the seminary here, this is sister ellara a newer arrival that is curious about the nobility and research institute intaact. so  i brought her tonight. i assume you are staying w/ familiy but you'd be welcome as any other brother would.
ys: absolutely would love to see how things are done in the city.
ed: of course, vasilia is known for its wine. but do appreciate the light likes moderation.
ys: yes yes, i do make sure to stay within the limits of my body. 
ed: very well. actually i do no need to speak to lord reeves and his grace, it would bore you ellara. how about as new comers to the city, why don't you escort 
ellara looks towards the duke: yes of course i would be delighted to
ellara: i come from Arkos and have found so many differences !
ysidor: <fake whisiper> it's me it's ysidor
ellara jolts: what
ysidor: i was told to put this on.
ellara: i am so glad this is you and not berridin.
ysidor: would you like some wine. 
ellara: ..why not.

nyx is watching what's happening. perception 7. he's focused on being the broody one, behind him. "whitaker 4, it's been a while". It's donnathan reeves. "how did your brother convince you to come here, last i heard you were up in boixden"

nyx: i was busy but he has a way of getting me to... join things i might normally not.
dr: aren't younger brothers.. have a way with their older sibilings, i know i do it with mine all the time:
n: indeed
dr: well you filled out a lot since the last time i sawy you
n: well thakn you, how have you been.
dr: well you did, last time i saw you at a party, yo uleft so abruptly it was so unfortunate, i was going to invite you to an afetr party, are you just going to disappear again?
n: i'm not very used... despite my upgringing this kind of party has never been my thing but my younger brother convinced me to stay.
dr: don't be a stranger, --slides hand on shoulder. and walks away
n stays calm but does not respond.

witty is dancing, he sees a girl "obviously" staring at him. he takes it as interest and moseys up to her. and shrugs eyebrows at her like "come". She has a blonde updo, high collared kind of rosy dress fills, fan. and when he does that she tries to and makes a gesture like "no". witty pivots to the girl next to her immediately. the group is turning inwards closing off the circle. he spins and goes back to the dance floor. he's flirting with young and old women and young men. he sees lady jacintha (who he hasn't met). she doesn't shoo him away. 

he bows and takes off his hat: "whitaker the 6th, how do you do" and takes her hand.
j: "lady jacintha, i did see you know viscount reevs i know his mother and live nearby her, how do you know him.
w: "oh our families go way back"
j: "oh, oh, are you a part of Arthur's brood"
w: oh yes i'm his youngest son.
j; it was different circles with the whitmans but i did hear how fruitful your family has been.
w: i've been so well off i was able to hire a new servant for only 20 a month
j: a new servant or another? but you are being highway robbed sweet child.
w: no no he's worth it his ethnic food is great
j: my child even a good servant is only worht a gold a month...
w: you look wonderful today, who are you wearing. 
j: oh this was something lucinda from weave and bob's on the golden arch. she does a wonderful job.
w: absolutely.
j: i saw you came witb some gentlement, your borthers?
w: yes whitake 3, 4 5 joined me.
j: so you're not attache to anyone tonight? 
w: yes i go where the flow takes me. and your dress is qukite flowy tonight. insight check: 18 - (she's a bit taken aback by the obvious flirt but she's still game, in a moment of self awareness notice she sees him as a ripe for the picking naive thing)
j: well yes, not to be uncouth or anything but with the right breeze and gentle winds many task become simpler.
w: can i get you a drink? 
j: by all means:
w he bows deeply with a wink and looks around, he snaps two champagne flutes with a spin. acrobaticas 15 check. 
j: bravo (with a refined clap)
w: little bow.
w asks about her.
j: i've been a widow for awhile, i've been a staple at these events ,friends with reeves' mom/neighboor. like to see what the young blood is up to and also the best gossip.
w: well this young blood is pumping and loves to hear some gossip... what's your juiciest.
j: well, lots of rumors about her grace ophelia... it seems she's returning from torchlight college but no formal engagement yet... there's buzz about the duke's intent with her niece. but the duke isn't having children as you know... as the heir she'll be expected to inherit. but we don't if he'll be as liberal with her as she is with him.
w: you're already wealthy right, you inherited your late husband's wealth yes?
j: he married into my wealth actually.. the marriage was arranged for his family'ls financial benefit and our connectios.

berridin takes a moment to study her facial expressions. she wants to know if she noticed him, does she look bored, etc. insight check nat 20. he sees someone that has trained all their life in nobility. everyone sees a kind gentle, niece, heir. polite interest. effective warmness but he sees beyond that, it's very cold and calculating, very performative. she's in her element. probably a reason she was chosen as heir. 

he makes his way to her. 

oph: "if i'm not mistaken you're whitaker the 3rd"
b: yes my lady my name is whitaker whitman the 3rd. 
oph: oh yes you know how it is, it's so draining to meet everyone in these things.
b: my dear lady if i could be so bold. i noticed you across the room and i have to say, you wear your role impecably, lady ophelia. and i don't mean to say you come across as fake or not genuine, i just approceiate your discipline.
oph mask drops for a second but wwiht a schooled face: i knew you were far more interesting than you let on, so you peackock for my attention? you're not the first little boy to try that.
b: i've learned in my travels those who appear to eager, those are usually the ones i can handle but the ones who hide their ambition through patience, now that is truly terrifying but i appreciate your demeanor.
oph: what ambitions, i have it all i am the heiress to the gran duchess. in all your traves is that what you have been doing after walking away?
b: i walked awy from them for a bit.
oph :like you carved out that young lady and caused a scandal, is this another scandal to make yourself relevant
b: i don't look for scandals but connections
opth; is that what you want right now a connection to the heir?
b: while you are an amazing catch and i'm sure you enjoy that attention on you for now. it's presemumptious to assume i'm only interested. 
oph: don't presume to punch so high, the best you could do is see the inside of my chambers.
b: it's usually a good sign when the lady brings up her chambers first.
oph: i could also bring the guards, i assume you don't want to embarass your brother.
b: would you want to dance.
oph: i suppose you did show yourself off in the dance floor.

ellara: who else came?
ysidor: the whole gang came. 
perception check 11. he goes to point out. he sees witty and jocintha. just saw berridin go into the dance floor with ophelia. he can't find nyx. 
y: berridin is dancy dancing with that pretty lady and he's number 3 or 4. i'm 5. there's another one that has a different number and nyx has different. I don't understand city folk theres' more names than 1-5.
ellara: so everyone's here. 
y: yes isn't it great.
ellara: so that's berridin
y: yeah he seems to be getting along with whoever. 
ellara: where's nyx?
y: he's somewhere around here. 
nyx perception w/ advantage - 10. 
---

berridin performance 16. she adjusts a bit to guide things.

oph: not bad, not bad, i guess a 3rd son can dance. 
ellara notices the song end and goes to "save" her.
oph: oh sister ellara.
ellara: my lady, i only got a brief window to talk to you before and i did so want to talk more yout.
oph: oh yes we did promise to do that. but i do owen sister ellara some girl to speak on these matters.
berridin: thank you for this dance, i suspect it won't be our last coupling. 
ellara 17 stealth to glare at berridin on the way out.
ophelia: it's so refreshing, i know eulogians aren't often at these events so it's.
ellara: 
oph: the teaching of the light is universal, the truth is the same same. it is unchanging. just 
ellara: came cause thought man bothering you.
oph: 
ellara: 
oph: it's easy to 
ellara: so he didn't 
oph: 
ellara: 

Ellara: Likewise, as interesting as the seminaries are, I’ve always wondered what it’s like to learn about the Light from such a different perspective. Ophelia: The teaching of the Light is universal. The truth is the same—Eternal Light is unchanging. It is just how the stories are woven that differs. 
Ellara: (Blushing) That is so true. I mainly came over because I was wondering if that man had been bothering you. 
Ophelia: So kind, Sister Alara. It often happens. Young noblemen often see a title and an opportunity. But do not be concerned. This is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I have had "tutors" of his ilk. 
Ellara: Of course, someone as beautiful as you must have all this time... 
Ophelia: No need for flattery. I am sure you get your own "tutors" at the seminary. The Light does include all kinds of love; you didn't take vows of chastity, did you? 
Ellara: No, back in the Highlands, if the devout followed that tradition, we would have died out long ago. Ophelia: Of course. Some try to use the Light to blind others—carrying a false light in their pocket like those crystals. Sometimes people mistake that for the Eternal Light. 
Ellara: It’s not fair... (covers mouth) I just meant, I've studied my whole life and you already seem so far beyond me in wisdom. 
Ophelia: (Lifts Alara's chin) Do not worry. Do not despair upon yourself or diminish your own might. I see much of the Light reflected in you.
Ellara: (Speechless) Thank you... I know this isn't protocol, but if you ever need someone who is just a friend, I am here. A friend your age. 
Ophelia: A true friend is a hard thing to find in this world, especially among this viper den. Maybe I'll take you up on that offer one day.

ophelia walks away towards grand duke.
---
witty has done the rounds. 
jacinta: well you've been quite the companion tonight, the ball is almost over... you did say you go with the wind and the winds are blowing home.
witty: i would be honored to sail with you.
j guides him to the front to take him home.
witty as he's walking out he sees nyx gives him two thumbs up.

night is wrapping down

berridin looks for other interesting targets. perecption 14. he sees ophelia go to her uncle, ellara is alone, ysidor with his tray still stealing food. witty in the arms in jacintha. he makes his way to lady ophelia and the duke. they are talking privately with donnathan reeves and the proctor. he wants to overhear. stealth check 23. 

oph: "so uncle, about those soldiers moved to the north, the resistance is stronger than expected"
duke: "yes it seems someone escaped and was able to rally them... i thought you (reeves) said the lighthouse handled it"
dr: we had it... not sure what happened, some people broke in and freed the subject.. we knew it wouldn't be easy. you'd think those shadowed would be a little more afraid of the light. a few new models would make short work of them.
ophelia puts a fan to her face in a shocked looked. 
dr: eduard, i know your... companion has been quite interested and has connections to this.
ed: don't worry about ellara, she's more pious than the light itself, if i tell her what to do she'll do it. i have been watching heree. she will do as expected. enough of these unpleasantries i must go find here.
dr: ollie, i think i have a new play thing for tonight.
---
berridin makes his way to ysidor. ysidor con saving throw (for alcohol) 16. he's still sober. there's 8 empty glasses around him. the servants are politely ignoring that area as b arrives.

b: i see you've been entertaining yourself brother.
y: yes the food and drinks keep coming without me even asking.
b: have you talked to anyone tonight. 
y: yes i talked to proctor eduard who was with ellara.
b: anyone else?
y: ellara
b: just make sure you're not drinking too much. 
y: i've only had 8 glasses.
b grabs a drink. 

he notices witty is leaving with jacintha. party is winding down.

b goes to witty as he's leaving to see if he needs help. luck check 57. he misses witty. b looks for nyx. he sees donnathan reeves next to nyx.
---
dr: so you're still here, you didn't leave
nyx: i'm a man of my word
dr: there's a little after party, would you like to attend?
nyx: ...yeah i think it'd do me some good. 
dr: yeah it'd do us all some good.

berridn does he see nyx's internal turmoil? insight 17 vs performance 18. NOPE. he does not interfere/cockblock UNLIKE ellara.
--
nyx is led to a more private quarter, he starts taking off some buttons.
dr: it's been a while since i saw whitman boys, i know i was a bit older but we did run in the same circles. 
nyx gives a low chuckle.
dr has his chest exposed and opens a door: after you
nyx nods and goes in.
nyx sees oleandar there with shirt sleevs rolled up with an amber drink in hand. it's a massive room. the door shuts behind him.
dr: ollie i brought a gift.
he sees the grand duke look up: "what is it this time my sweet"
nyx feels dr's arm come around him from behind: "this little one" puts a finger on his face. "he tried to trick us"
dr: the whitman's... i don't know them well but there is nothing under the light that would bring the 4th son to bastion city... that was witty but... who are you, what brought you?
nyx says nothing. he looks at both of them and leans against a wall.
dr: a silent type... wouldn't be the first one i make scream... poor poor witty.. all he wants is the love of his family... you made friends with him... then that would probably make the other two not real. at least 2 other conspirators. obviously one of you was not the greatest of the brother, the other... dear ophelia... good luck to him. what to do now. hmm hmmm hmm. are you sure you don't want to say anything, i do like the strong silent type.
nyx: what makes you think i'm not his brother.
dr: like i said, everything witty wants is the love of his family... 1 and 2 would be too obvious, his parents sent him here to be out of sight, so all of you showing up.. you all up in boixden, there's a reason while there's not much opportunity for 3+ children, there's no gain for you to come here... the 4th son got away from the family, it's harder to get further to boixden, the chances are very very high you aren't that.
nyx: he is a sweet kid indeed. 
nyx exhales and grabs the bridge of his nose.
nyx shrugs: i thought something like this would happen, i AM his brother and you're right I thought there wouldn't be a reason to come back, but i woanted some information so here i am. but you've drawn me out.
dr: interesting if true, so you're just using the brother for something else and the other 2 happened to be here in this backwater (to the duke we know it is honey).
nyx: actually i don't know why they are are here but he did a damn good job bringing us together this time. *sigh* i said too much.
deception check vs insight: 8 deception vs 13+modifierr.

proctor eduard finds ellara.
"sister ellara it's time to return to seminary"
"oh it was quite lovely, i will"
Ellara: I don't know that I remember most of the names, but I made notes to study later. And it was so nice to see Eulogia so prominent in the Ducal family. 
Edward: Yes, Ophelia has been devout since a young girl. Strict upbringing as the heir. But tell me, I saw you talk to Donathan and the Duke—were you able to find out anything more about what happened? 
Ellara: Well, Donathan just returned. He put an inquiry at the Dustbreaker Lighthouse, but he mentioned a ruckus there too. Things are in disarray, lots of fires to put out. But he assured me they are investigating exactly what happened. 
Edward: Good. 
Ellara: I am so happy people here are interested in finding the truth. People back home warned me everyone here was scheming, but it’s great to know that’s not the case. 
Edward: Well, there are no saints. Some give in to their shadowed nature. But we are not as scary as made believe. Often you gain new friends when you leave home. 
Ellara: I certainly have a lot of growing to do if I ever want to catch up. 
Edward: It is not a race, my child. With enough light and water, the plant will grow. (He guides her into the carriage).

return to dr conversation-
dr: well then. what was the information you needed, maybe i can provide it whitaker the 4th. 
nyx stony faced: in my travels i've heard whispers of a situation that i don't have enough information on but i'm trying to figure it out... you may know some of this but i'm a little hesitant to ask you.
dr: i'd be a little less hesitant, a call from either of us and you'd be in the deepest prisons...
n: do you know anything about the use of shadowed to power our entire city. 
dr: our city is not powered entirely by shadows, what do you mean?
n: that's the whispers i have heard.
dr: all the way up in boixden that's what you heard?
n: i wasn't just up there. i like to stay under the radar.
dr:  i'm sure you do. i'm the director of relations at the lighthouse, and have not heard anything as barbarous as that. but the crystals are mined... nothing in the light would be as dark as that.
n: oh then what are thes rumors about..
dr: it's not so hard, people will doubt the new technology... the shadowed, maybe not the most orthodox thting, but they are a convenient boogey man... it's just fearmongering and ignorance.
n: you'd know best... mmm
dr: is that all whitaker the 4th.
n: well that was a lot. i apologize for bothering you with such a question.s
dr: well then you and your "brothers" can go home, i have a duke to take care of. don't slam the door on the way out. 

a guard escorts you on the way out. 
---
berridin is seething that his "brothers" got lucky when he's supposed to be the playboy. he sees nyx escorted out not looking disheveled.
berriding puts his arm around nyx to take him off the guard. 
nyx: let's talk in private. let's get the others.
they grab ysidor. 

nyx: so i want to say i met with oleandar and donnathan in person, in their office. they suspected me thinking i was not whitaker the 4th. i did my best and asked them directly if they knew what was going with the taking of the shadowed and powering the light crystals. the bad news is they said... no nothing, nothing's going. donnathan lied but was hoping to get info from oleandar. didn't get any info. don't think it's a good idea for us to be disugised as the whitakers anymore as they are suspicious of all of us. witty isn't here, they are fairly sure he's himself but the rest of us they suspect us. at a loss but we do need to be careful.
berridin: so just to be clear you didn't actually score? 
nyx: no i don't swing that way.
berridin very exicitedly: ok good, whew. as me what i ound out.
nyx: what?
b: i managed to overhear a call between the 4 most powerful ppl in the city. they are aware that meri has instigated a rebelliion that's slowing them down.
ysidor happy: that's sounds like meri.
b; she's a thorn in their side. everyone seems to be aware of what's happening. they're all , from what i could gather, the duke, the niece, dr, and proctor eduard. they all seem to be somewhat aware, they're all super racist against shadowed. but i really don't think that eduard is as good as ellara makes him seem to be.
nyx: that much is certain.
b: what do i do guys. this guy is bad news, he basically said he has ellar wrapped around his finger but you know her, she's not going to believe me.
---
morning
witty wakes up in bed. alone. a bit bruised, a bit sore. kind of tired. once he decides to leave the bedroom he sees jacintha all done up drinking tea. "oh there's some extra breakfast for you young sir, i do hope you find yourself home safely"
witty waddles to the table and declines sitting down and grabs something to eat. "i enjoyed myself too, that was great. it was quite the range of ppl at that ball last night. i know you shared some juicy gossip with me. anything else"
j: it looks like your brother tried to flirt with the heiress but to no avail as proctor eduard's guest sought her compianinship instead.  maybe you'll have more gossip for me, please at least send a letter if you can with those details.
w forgot he had gone with anyone but realizes he shoud go check his home.
---
nyx knows there's a drop spot nearby through his underworld connections. there's a new commission, open to whoever can do it. the first thing on it is a stylized black swan. these are requests from an infamous figure, they showed up in the last few years. they are lucrative but dangerous and extremely well paid. this request is asking for the head of the leader of the stone goliath in hyrta. 250 gold. he takes note of it and decides to tell the group later. on the way back he sees a lost figure in purple robes. 

nyx: it's me, alexander - and he winks
witty: ah mr alexander. how was your evening,
N: quite good, quite god.
w: i seem to have lost my clothes, do you know where my tailor is? 
n: no but i can lead you home.
