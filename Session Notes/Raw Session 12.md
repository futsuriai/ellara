nyx takes witty and leads him home, which has everyone but ellara.
witty expressses that he needs to bathe.
when they get there, he walks to his bathroom disrobing as he gets there. completely naked other than a purple hair cap which he puts on, and a loofa.
nyx closess the front door which witty left open.
ysidor sees berridin starting to pocket the silver and paintings, wondering how much they are worth.
nyx looks at the group and sits down
"i think he's gonna take a bath...?" @witty "can we grab whatever"
w: "make yourself at home"
-----

to the group + sending stones to ellara

nyx: "on one the contract boards for bounty hunters like me... the black swan, a patron who we don't know the identity of, they are very reliable for difficult high risk/reward contracts... those jobs are a big deal. i saw a bullet from them. someone put a hit out on Meri. certain people would read it as assassination but it's vague enough to say that if the problem is removed... it's fine. I say we take the contract, others have seen it too. It's 250 gold. we get the gold, rescue her. now the only issue is, what is the problem. they just want her to disappear, we can get her to safety and if she doesn't show up again we're good."

ellara: <raising hand invisibly> we both met the same meri right, she won't stop fighting for her ppl.

berridin tosses his sending stone to ysidor, ysidior: how does this work again... Meeeri?? ding ding ding (at berridin's instigation he needs to make a sound)

meri after fumbling sounds: little hill? 

y: meri? it's me ysidor.

m: little hill? the stone you gave me started making noise, i guess this is how it works.
y: i don't know the city folk have strange magic, you're in this stone and i need to give you a message.
m: i don't.. sigh
y: we have news that black swans are coming to kill you
m: we usually don't get swans up here but they are easy to get rid of
y: maybe these are city black swans, i don't get it either
nyx: can i explain it
y: bye meri
nyx: hello, meri.
meri: youre.. nyx right?
nyx: i figured i'd be able to give a better overview
m: what's this about swans?
nyx: i'm a bounty hunter and saw a job on our bulletin board that someone named the black swan, a person, not a bird. posted a job. not going to mince words, a very well paid job to remove... you. by name. meri and a description of you. the good news is that it was "remove". we wanted to let you know to discuss what we could do about this.
m: that would explain all these men and the sitting army not far away. they've been encamped for a few days but haven't done much, something about a ducal decree. same reason i came back, looks like this grand duke is not taking no and using force to get access to the mountains.
nyx: honestly the black swan is probably the duke.
berridin: hey mommy it's berridin, how many men did you spot.
m: i'm not your mother, little one, first of all. *sigh* of course little hill would make friends like this... by my reconing about 20 soldiers but they haven't moved yet. 
b: at their strength levels how much of a threat are they.
m: we could probably take out most of them but it would be a strange strategy to come out with only 20 of them.
b: you've been a real thorn in their side meri so i tihnk they're gonna send even more powerful reinforcements your way.
m: depending on what you mean.. yes? we're just a small village at the foot of the mountaint
b: how long would it take us to reach you?
m: a few weeks. 

witty opens the door to the bathroom "has anyone seen my rubber ducky"
berridin: yes it's on the mantle. (what am i doing).
w: who are you talking to 
n: meri
w: who's meri
m: i'm meri.
n: she's ysidor's mentor.
w: are they happy.
y: she's content i would say.
w: sounds cheery. 
b: go finish your bath.
nyx: the adults are talking. 
w closes the door.

berridin intelligence check: dirty 1. he's concerned about getting there on time with warforged on the way.
ellara: why do we need to go there, why can't she just come here.
witty sticks his head out and offers to call a carriage.
ysidor: we should go to my village, it's a great village. 
berridin: does anyone know of any teleportation capabilities. 

ellara 3 intelligence check: the idea of teleportation circles seem insane. you understand the concept but no.

witty comes out dressed in undergarments. intelligence check: 10. he's been idly paying attention, what he was told is that if you are moving big equipment it would take longer than traditional methods. you know that if teleportation existed it would not go to bumfuck nowhere and they'd use it for the warforged. but basically the party could be faster than the warforged being transported. 

b: witty do you have a carriage
w: yes but i'm not sure if i have horses, haven't seen them since jarvis left.
b: let's get horses then.
w: i could ask lady jacintha? 
b: definitely try, also check if she has a hot air balloon?
w: that'll give us a good chacnce to talk about your compensation.
berridin is mindlessly picking up witty's clothes before realizing and throws them back down.
w: just so you know i like them ironed and pressed for next time.

w+berridin go to jocinthas.

servant: madam, your from last night has returned.
j: oh witty what brings you back? (in night clothes)
w: unfortunately not coming back for more, i have a favor.
j: oh a favor? ooh ooh
w: do you know where i can procure an air balloon?
j: ohh.. they're all the vogue, if you go to dunston's and kirk's you might be able to, they are not cheap though.
w: perfect, (gives her hand a kiss) o do you have any horses too? 
j: oh it's only 10 minutes away
berridn prods w: do you have enough money for the hot air balloon.
w: yeah, they can charge it to my family's account
b: no no, lady jocintha. how much would a hot air balloon cost.
j: i am no tinkerer or merchant but i would assume a cheap one... 100 gold or so? 
b (oh nyx should have that) - nyx gets chills down his spine.
w: oh wow that's only like 2 days salary for din.
j gently puts a hand on him: darling we spoke of this, no servant is worth that much... din was it, are you trying to rob this man blind.
b: i charge by services procured.
j: with all due respect i would have heard of you.
b: among the top servants discretion is a top value..
j: they like to gossip... i mould know... i would be carefully of your company as he seems to be a swindler.
w: i trust him with my life.
j: then you are a fool and a fool and his money will soon be parted.
w: i have enough.
the servant motions them to leave.
w: call me
j: surely.
----
b: how was last night?
w: i had some hits of gas but i think it went well
b: how much gold do you have on you?
w: 25.
b: how are you gonna keep paying me if you don't have more gold.
w: we agreed you'd handle expenses
b: i thought i was gonna attach myself to you and get rich quick, but it seems i'm going back to my original benefactor, nyx. i'm taking a leave of absence.
w: can you still make me suits
b: we'll see
---
b: we're going to try to procure a hot air balloon.
nyx: does anyone here know how to use them
w: i know about gas, i understand thermodynamics.
b: can you make argon somehow?
nyx: oh boy.
b: it'll be around 200 gold.
nyx: i don't have that kind of funds on me.
w: i'm money poor. i'm just a billionaire down on his luck.
b: god damn it.
ellara (over stone): what do you mean hot air balloon? like in the sky? how does that work? is that safe?
nyx takes out a knife and starts playing with it: finder's fee...
nyx: how big is the basket? can we fit?
w: wind and heat, my dear. depending on the wind, a week to six months.
b: witty, do you have a map?

they go to a map, with pins of his favorite places.
nyx: so yu don't have a plan
w: we have a concept of a plan.
nyx: here's our milk toast idea. as mr moneybags single handedly funding this, i need more to go off of.
ysidor: 30% stake.
b: who has the best map skills?
servival checks: nyx 16. you know it's 4 weeks, nnw, 4 weeks by foot. if you took a hot air balloon you could cut down the time, but the war forged would take a while, longer than 4 weeks. a large army would go also around 4 weeks. in a carriage probably 2 weeks. hot air depends on the winds. 
witty cuts a lock of din's hair. throws them out the window to judge the wind. intelligence check w/ advantage. 12. if you could keep the winds favorable also around 2 weeks. if not. who knows.-

din: do you want to vote on what to do?
din: ysidor you're such a... you have one element left to conquer, you've conquered the earth. think of what yo ucould conquer in the skies. nyx, this is really a great place to flex your fancy warddrobe and i  think there's some potential that we could get there really really fast. 
nyx: look, i'm warming to the idea. but if the weather is against us... we could double our time.
ellara: if the winds are against you, you just not making it.
witty: so could we procure some horses and hang them from ropes from the hot air balloon so that if it happens, we have an additional one, or we can like float just high enough off the ground.
berridin: holy shit.
nyx: ok i'm fine with the hot air balloon.
nyx: but you gotta get me the cheapest price. and if i find out you're taking off the top...
b: i'm ready to haggle.
w: i really trust him. he's been over the highest level of integrity. never lied to me once.

nyx to witty puts a hand on him: you're a good guy. (then walks away)
nyx: alright lets go. 

they all decide to go check out the hot air balloon place.
---
description: big craft shop, gnomes, dwarves, halflings, elves working. loud blacksmith noises, metal being worked, different smells. entrance has a counter with someone working on documents.
a dwarf is manning the place.
berridin walks in
B; hello we are looking to procure a hot air balloon and heard this is the place.
dwarf: yes yes we just started taking orders. seems some ofthe nobels want to see what all the fuss is about.
witt: purple.
dwarf: purple does tend to be more expensive.
nyx: no we don't.
witty: cost is no issue
berridin: we have a weight requirement.
nyx: maybe 6 or 7.
berriding: what ranges do you have.
dwarf: this is bespoke, it's up to the customer. 
berridin: what's the upper limit
d: i wouldn't go above 10 humans.
nyx: i want a dark color.
dwarf that's fine.. 10 people.
berridin: propulsion, how does that work?
d: the gas in the balloon is heated and it rises. that's.. .it you go up the wind takes you. but you're at the mercy of the winds.
nyx: is there.. forgive me if this istupdi, is there any way to have forward propulsion.
d: these are leisure vehicles, it's for casual use. we have never had demand for that. reserach into that would be heavy. 
nyx: are there other vehicles that would let us do more directed exploration.
d: oh you want a personal airship? i'm sure you have a few thousand gold for this.
w: what would be the deposit?
d: usually 20% and it'll take some months.... for a balloon, 200 gold, some weeks, propulsion research 50-100 + several weeks.
b: what's the fastest we can get one?
d: 4 weeks. 
b: what about any of these?
d: we. are. a bespoke. place.
w: any existing orders with purple.
luck chcek 64 (needed 5 or less)
d: no.
nyx: sorry can i speak to my friends. 
dwarf: as i said we do have prior clients, unless you wish to pay they will be prioritiized.
ellara: s-see i think tihs is a sign we were not meant to go in the air.
b: why don't we put a deposit down and get an airship later? ask for a loaner?
b: do you have a hot air balloon that can be pulled by horses? like a floating carriage? paragliding?
d: no. we don't sell stuff on the first place. i understand the appeal but we do not have such a thing.
b: can it be upgraded later? what is your most exciting hot air balloon tech?
d: no post sales modification. new contract. we are not the duskbreaker lighthouse. we are a facility that creates devices. no r&d.
witty: can we steal someone's hot air balloon. 
nyx: sorry, this is not going to work. there will be soldiers there by the time the balloon is even ready. 
witty: what if you put a deposit down, then when it's ready we get it delivered. 
nyx: money on delivery... (eye roll).
nyx: thank you so much for your time, we realize a carriage would be better.
witty bows after thanking for his time
---
ellara goes to the seminary to pick up her stuff. she finds proctor eduard.
e: i might have to be away for a while. related to the goliath business. i will continue my studies on the way.
eduard: i understand. you do add a lot to the seminary but i understand the calling. go forth, you have my blessing.
proctor eduard hands her a book: Josephine's insights on the nature of eulogia. (early church theology)
e: wow. i won't misplace your trust.

group rents horses/carriage.
nyx: 30 gold is great.
berridin haggles: how about 20 gold?
dwarf: 28.
b: meet me in the middle at 24.
d: 26.
b: deal.
nyx: i heard the whole thing. 26 it is.
berridin pockets the 4 gold difference as a "finder's fee".
they leave the city. it's late afternoon.
