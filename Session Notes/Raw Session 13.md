it is evening, we have horses, carriage.
nyx: we're heading out tomorrow morning, we're leaving at first light, make sure you have your things.
witty wants to know if he can withdraw funds from the bank, turn back time for a moment and lets retcon that he went to the bank with berridin
---
ornate building, all made out of stone, neoclassic and art deco. as he goes in, massive doors. inside gorgeous tiles, bronze works. further in there's guards at the door, at least 2. a few others. a line and one teller of a sort and after a bit in line, maybe 10-20 mins.

she goes: good afternoon sir, how may i help you
witty: good afternoon, i'm of the whitman estate and need to a do a withdrawal
teller: goes back to a wall, pulls out a massive volume.. i see the last withdwradal was authorized by a jarvis? 
witty: how much?
teller: every week around 200 gold. 
witty: when was the last one.
teller: around 2 weeks ago?
witty: can i do last week's and this week's? 400
teller: it would seeem... the last withdwral, he depleted the last of the funds.
witty: well... jarvis left more than 2 weeks. at least mentally. i think this is fraud.
teller: this is unfortunate but clients are responsible to grant authorization, we're not liable if you don't revoke access. there's no way for us to know there's fraud here. in fact he's still allowed to withdraw.
w: first, have you heard of my father. lord whitman. he's good for any reimbursmement for a forward that you could provide on loan.
teller: should your father pull out a loan i would need his prescence, there are many nobles that do that and it's our best practice to have them be in person. 
w: oh yeah, he's right outside, should i go get him?
t: suuure, why not.
w tells berridin to come with him, and asks if he can make him a suit that looks like his dad, actually berridin should be his dad.
b asks for a description.
w makes a minor illusion of his dad, Igor Whitman the 2nd. (the first died, his color is rainbow/opalescent).
b casts disguise self.  deception check 11.  all the major parts are right, in essence, but if you looked very closely and knew the dad... something might be off
berridin is overconfident.
they leave the backalley and go back into the bank.
they don't even stand in line, they just go to the same teller.
Teller: lord whitman i assume.
Berridin: yes, i'm here with my youngest most unaccomplished son.
Teller: i'm glad he was able to find you, before we approve this we just need to confirm thing. a lot of young nobles down on their luck/gamblings are impersonating their parents.
b: hooligans!
t: yes we want to make sure no hooligans.
teller looks at him: oh i see... yes yes... there was some magic detected however it seems nobles these days, they very much like to put off a little bit more than they are.
b: don't give away my secrets young lass.
t: given that your were a little less than honest and i can see the family resemblance.. we will need some liability. we can put a lien against the estate if you wish.
b: yes, sure, no problem. 
t 5 mins later with a large stack of papers:  please sign on the x, we can give you a 1k loan but if you don't pay back we can take the estate. repaymentes start in 1 month.
b: can you see my account?
t: yes but without a statement from the vaselian bank that is encoded magically i would'nt be able to use it from within bastion city. but i'm sure you'll be able to pay this.
b: yes, yes, of course.
witty: would we be able to do 2000 against the property.
t: hold on, for 2k we would have to go to city to evaluate the property.
w: that'll take too long, 1500?
t: 1k.
w: 1.1k?
t: it will be starting in a months time, 100 monthly. 
w: how about a water. 
t: yes there's a self serve fountain there.
w: you got this din... dad.
t: yes, in a month 100 gold for 10 months. if you don't pay in the first month you will owe the full amount, then we'd take the property. 
b: surely our property is worth more.
t: as i told your son, this is a default amount, for a larger amount we'd have to go to city records, we can't guarantee any other amount without that process.
b: ok ok, this should be enough for now. 
t: just sign these documents.
b starts sigining in bad handwriting.
t: here's you 1k gold, please make your payments.
berridn takes it and puts it in his bag.
b: come along witty
w: did you get the gold dad?
b: i have the gold we can distribute it later.
after leaving
b: we probably need to figure this out later
w: my dad's good for it
b: how would he know
w: i'll write him a letter
b: why don't i hold on to this for now and figure out what to do with it later.
w: sure that sounds good.
b: haha, kind of like you're my servant now
w: well you're carrying the heavy gold, i like to be light on my feet.
----
back to the evening before this retcon.
witty tells everyone that din has our money, he's got it covered
nyx; how much did you pull out?
berridin: we have enough?
nyx: no no what's the number? it's important.
berridin: we have the most gold i've ever seen
nyx: berridin?
b: i don't have to answer you anymore
nyx: how much do you have witty?
w: i have around 25 gold
nyx: how much did you withrdaw?
w: i was getting water, b got the loan.
berridin: we got a 2000 loan, we'll need to repay that.
nyx: i don't believe your number
b: i've never told you a lie
ysidor: it's not good to lie.
nyx: i just want to know what our funds are. 
w: i did ask for 2000 gold.
nyx rolls insight 19. beats 19 agaivst berridin's 19 deception.
he almost had him convinced, then he thinks about their relationship.
b: you caught me it was 3000. 
berriding deception w/ disadvantage 17. nyx insight w/ advantage 16. he can't quite believe it but who knows. their relationship, would it really surprise you if it was 3000.
nyx: i get that you don't want to tell me. is it over 1000. i just want to know the minimum.
b: are you saying you can match our funds. i saw you a few days ago, i pulled out 80 gold from your vaault. i think, why am i the one on trial. 
nyx: i'm paying for everything.
b: these are emergency funds for witty and i to live off of. we might start a zeppelin business, we might need this.
ellara: why do we even need money, we'll just be on the road.
nyx: we might need supplies, or passage. 
ellara: i thought we would just live off the land like anyone does when travelling.
nyx: maybe we need it for passage, we will just see as it comes.

long rest.
---
it's early to get a good head start. 2 horses. nyx is on a horse. ysidor is guiding the carriage.
animal handling: nyx(12), ysidor(15). nyx struggles a little but is mostly fine.
we see the sleeping warforged on the sides as we exit the gate. and now we're on the main road. during the ride in a nice and padded carriage. 

berridin decides to talk to ellara:
asks about her relationship with Proctor Eduard; she says he's the dean, respected, trustworthy, and looking into things at high levels.
berridin says he overheard the duke, princess, Proctor Eduard, and Donnathan Reeves discussing the light crystal issue at the party; says Eduard seemed in cahoots and mentioned Ellara was wrapped around his finger.
ellara doubts berridin (says he's cried wolf, hard to believe he snuck up on them), but appreciates the warning and says she'll be careful.
berridin casts disguise self as Proctor Eduard to repeat the words and rolls a performance check to sell it. 10.
gm says ellara decides if she believes it.
---
houses and now farther and farther apart. the road is getting a bit rougher. ysidor remembers the path. it's more woodsy. occassionally see worn paths and lights. we settle in to camp by the evening. eat evening meal. see from the shadows we hear branches breaking and a young lady comes into the campfire, she has a a baby on her back.

lady: hello. i saw your fire in the distance, i was hoping i could share safety in numbers. i'm sorry, i have been walking trying to get home from bastion city and it's kind of scary here. and my baby... having some company would be so nice.
ysidor: of course come sit down.
she sits besides him, the baby is getting a bit upset.
ysidor: can i see the baby?
lady: i'm just trying to get him to settle and cries if others hold him. 
ysidor: oh ok, if i could see him before he falls asleep that would be great.
ellara: do you need some food, we have some extra rations 
lady says she's been traveling a few weeks and doesn't want to impose, but her stomach growls.
ellara says it's the duty of those in the light to provide and offers food; ysidor says hyr would want them to share the love around the campfire.
ysidor: yes hyr would want us to share the love of everyone around the campfire.
lady: thank you so much, she eats with one hand while holding the baby
witty: so what's your name?
lady: samantha.
witty: is that a mrs samantha or?
lady: pardom me?
witty: well samantha jr here is her dad around?
lady: oh yes, the father, it would seem... i come from outside the city, some merchant's son promised me the world, but once little julia was born he cast us aside.
ysidor is crying fully: such a strong mom, doing the best you can. 
ellara: can you tell us who this man was, i would like to report him when we are back to the city.
lady: he has too much money to face consequences... i think his name was something dupree... 
nyx is by the fire, watching, on the name he leans in.
lady: from the dupree family, brenton.
nyx: i'm sorry to hear that.
witty: in which direction are you heading?
lady: not too much farther, in a few days there's a split in the road before my parent's.
witty: would you like to travel with us?
lady: i couldn't
nyx: come with us.
witty: i can take a horse and give you my spot in the carriage.
lady: well if you insist i don't mind... what kind of sicko do you think i am
witty: says he can ride next to ysidor, they'll be great friends.
gm says the baby is swaddled and she just got him to settle, so she doesn't want to show his face.
nyx looking at her rolls investigation: 14. he realizes, he's seen this before, this is a disguise, this is a spell, disguise self. and for a moment he sees beyond it, something familiar. nyx of all people. it's someone in his industry. 
organization: 

lady has ellara and ysidor next to her, nyx on opposite side, witty between nyx/ellara, berridin ysidor/nyx.

nyx very slowly takes out his crossbow, puts it on his lap. as if playing with it, maintaining it, puts a bolt on. and points it at the woman. "you are in disguise, and you are lying to us. and i know that you are like me. you are a bounty hunter. how about we drop the act and you show us who you really are."

---
combat is over
---
nyx searches the body, he finds the tools of the trade. and a note saying "hyrda". 
nyx tells everyone. she was on her way to go after meri. this may not be the last time we encounter a bounty hunter; more may be after meri, so heads on a swivel.
berridin: thanks nyx for being wary. good that you're distrustful.
ysidor turns back to the group: ok but where is the baby.
he starts looking. "scatter around the baby is around somewhere"
nyx: there is no baby.
ysidor: well not right now, we have to find it.
nyx: there was no actual baby, it was a spell. 
ysidor: i'm starting to think i shouldn't trust anymore. this would never happen in my village.
nyx: we need to be a lot more careful, all of us. this is dangerous what we're doing. 
berridin: i admit we were taken in. maybe there needs to be a protocl.
ysidor; but she had a baby.
witty: i would rather by stabbed a million times than let a baby go cold.
nyx: let's keep it simple, do not trust anyone we meet until we've verified. i let her sit. i didn't push her away but i checked. that's what i asked.
berridin: nods. looks at ellara, might want to verify old friends as well.
ellara is on the verge of tears and goes almost into fetal position by the fire.
nyx walks over gently puts a hand on her shoulder; "i think we're done for the day, let's just rest for the night" 
ellara quietly says thank you.
witty: you guys are really lucky i was there today
berridin/witty decide to sleep in the carriage.
nyx: could you assume this will happen again, can you prep something 
1d8 for gold from the body. 2 pieces. 
witty makes some tinkerer tools to be able to create some items.
---
long rest
--- 
at dawn she goes to do a prayer over the body. nyx goes with her. 
ellara: thank you for coming i know it probably had to be done but...
nyx: i do bad things but i'm not a monster. 
ellara smiles slighty but says nothing.
witty makes another elixir... it's a... resilience (boldness generated the previous day).
in the carriage. witty tinkering. ellara reading very intently. 
next few days go smoothly. on the 7th day. a late morning cresting a hill. you'll be able to see the village in the distance. ysidor sees a small encampment, smoke rising from it, the livery of the grand duke. tents, 20 or so soldiers. Also see your village.
gm says everyone levels up at the end of the session.

session... ends..
