ellara believes there's a mistake
beridin swears that's what happened
nyx "i understand what you're thinking, but if he is involved why would he tell you"
ellara "it's the right thing to doy"
nyx: "maybe he'll deny it, if you reach out it'll make finding the truth more difficult, i'm speaking from experience, we should find out on our own"
ellara just looks at him
nyx: "this is challenging, what does everyone else think?"
nyx: i want to know what's happening, why his name was on the list, want to speak to the people involved
ellara: that's what i said
nyx: how would you know about this
ellara had already broached the subject
ellara: i think it would be fine to ask him, he wouldn't react in these ways
ysidor: you should always trust your elders
ellara: i think it would be fine to go now and ask
ysidor to berridin: what's a seminary
berridin whispers back: a kind of sex dungeon thing
nyx overhearing slaps berrdin: it's a religious school
nyx: how would you ask about it? what will you say about how you learn about this.
ellara: i just heard about it
nyx: you don't want to lie, it'll put you in a bad situation. he will press on this, you'll have to say you were at the guardhouse in the prison. are you going to lie?
ellara: i don't want to lie.
nyx: concerned you will tell him everything we've done, he knows you'll tell him everything.
-- get to the seminary, starting to get to evening -- 
nyx: we're in your world now, what do you want us to do
ellara: it would be hard for you to be there, maybe you should wait outside, especially you master nyx
nyx: i'll be able to blend more at "The Drunken Goose"
ellara: are you sure you'l be ok?
nyx: i'll be fine, we'll see you in an hour, if not we'll assume something bad, do try to get to the gate first
berridin tries to drag nyx away, "you remind me of an old guy tha goes on and on"
nyx: you know there's a 50/50 chance we never see her again
moose: please use protection
ellara: i don't think that will be necessary
---
they walk to the bar, they cross down, not far, maybe 5 mins from the gate. the group of 4 arrives at the bar, "take a table grab your drinks" kind of place. grab a table in the middle of the room. it's a nice bar/pub but people at the seminary might think it's seedy/worldly. artisan/soldier/working class (for the west of the city). context: similar financial bracket as nyx. 

nyx said it's on him
nyx: i'll have mead
berridin goes to the bar

"barkeep"
- what do you want darlin
berridin: 4 pints please
"of what"
berridin: ale please
"what kind"
berrdin: whatever is in this oak barrel
they carry the heavy mugs and spill a bit on the way back

 tsi'nyra never tried alcohol before and tries a sip. it reminds her of the long grass, of sitting in the sun. that ferment-y smell. it's not unpleasant for her. she's been taking notes in her journal about her experieneces. Con save 10 (7) fail. Her skin tingles a little. maybe she feels a little tingly. calmness. jiteriness. spending all day in the sun. energized, maybe a bit tipsy.

berridin going to town even though he's small and got a pint.
moose: you're too jump to drink - and takes berridin's mug
he goes to to the bar and asks for apple juice
"we don't run tabs here, and your friend did not tip"
nyx just hands over the money
moose brings back the apple juice, berridin begrudgingly likes
moose takes and drinks the extra mug he had taken
---
ellara goes to her dorm quickly.
touches a small riverstone and says "wish you were here to help me"
does a small ritual
goes to office
knocks
"what can i do for you"
“If a lantern-keeper shifts a great candle into a side chamber before dawn and later swears the flame never left the hall, has he served the Light—or hidden it?”
"what is this really about"
"the goliath this morning, why didn't you bring it up"
"after you brought it up, i looked into it, i set her free after talking to her"
"that's great!"
"she was concerned about her village, but she's now on her way home"
"why did it happen"
"it seems the duskbreaker tower, some reasearch was being done nearby, those shadowed you know how they are and she panicked."
"do you know when she left for home, the people that wanted her would be so happy"
"we just talked this morning so she should be half a day away"
"do you happen to know which village?"
"it was named after some blasphemous deity"
"thank you!"
as she's going out
"not all that you hear in the shadows is the truth, the shadows may deceive and not be the language of the light"
"oh! what did nites speak?"
"an older form of common"
"why"
"oh i just felt like there was another"
"like i said the shadows can deceive"
she goes to wait at the gate
--- 
tsi'nyra starts to giggle but doesn't get too drunk. 
the group goes back from the bar to the gate
---
nyx: "good news"
ellara: nods happily, your mentor was freed today master ysi--moose
ysidor: i need to go find her!
nyx: where is she going?
ellara: some time named after... anothre god 
ysidor: i should go
nyx: let's rest up for the night and head out in the morning. can we catch up to her?
ysidor: i mean, potentially, if she's on foot and we took other means?
nyx: how far is her home?
ysidor: it's netx to my home... it took me like a month to get here from there
berridin (drunkly): we should head out NOW
nyx: have you ridden a horse @ellara
ellara: of course... you look like you're wearing too fine a clothes to not use a carriage
nyx: ellara are you coming?
ellara: i'm a student, what would you need me for?
berridin (slurring): do-do you really trust this guy? that his mentor is heading home
ellara: of course, he wouldn't lie to me with a direct question
ysidor: you should come too, you can see my house and try food. they might hold a festival to the goddess for you!
ellara: rubbing her forehead... this might be an opportunity (to convert)
--- 
let's meet at the east gate at the morning light
---
denmother: you're up late
ellara: i need to sleep early to help others find the light in a journey.
denmother: i was lucky enough to do it in ordonne.
ellara packs a pouch, a letter, a pouch of herbs, a river stone and some supplies
writes out a letter before sleeping
---
nyx to nyra: just grab what you came with, i'll get ready
---
berridin/ysidor: disguise wears off, they squeeze in to the halfing area 
---
people make it to the gate.
---
early in the morning, the lights are extinguishing as dawn rises.
ysidor is ecstatic as he'll see his mentor again.

nyx: can anyone heal?
ysidor: raises his hands and they glow
ellara: the light can heal
nyx: i can heal
---
go to rent a carriage
---
ellara decides to ride (7 animal handling), horses get spooked but eventually get going
on the main road, they're well travelled, gravelly.
there's fields and trees around
as you leave there's also farms etc
---
ellara to ysidor: can you tell me more about your goddes
y: she's name hyr, she represents love of any kind, she embraces all and is truly the heart of my village, every season we braid long grass to each other as a sign of love, then we toss it into the fire and create a new gift. - he pulls out such a braid from behind his hair.- this was given to me by my mentor
ellara: in arkos we have similar rituals. how much have you heard of eulogia.
y: haven't really.
ellara: perhaps i'll have to tell you the stories of the pilgrimage.. they are quite enlightening (teehee)
---
we see a campfire ahead.
---
ellara: that must be your mentor
nyx: let's be careful
---
tsi'nyra's leopard can go scout.
instructions: stealthy, it ignores that and runs ahead. comes back 5 mins later. it speaks to her "smells metal, foreign, weird metal shapes, no one's there"
tsi: no human?
leopard: nothing living, fire just went out.
---
we approach cautiously.  we see 3 metal figures around the fire. they look rusted, worn by age. berridin gets even closer (he had stealthed previously).
it looks like something sitting down/slumped is there.
he tries to get even closer, within like 20 feet.
he looks more closely, tries to get even closer, 10 feet.
perception roll:  1. 
it's a bit dark, maybe it's a goliath? but it's not moving?
berridin pops his head out and approaches.
the figure gets up.
red eyes turn on. the the three figures rose with metallic sounds. almost as big as a goliath. made of scrap metal.

COMBAT IS OVER
---
investigation: berridin: you notice there's a relief brand on the backs of the constructs. almost like a manufacturers mark.
ellara sketches it.

perception: tsi'nyra: notice the fire pit. it looks like it was an intentional firepit. it was for a quick fire. a lot of needles and leaves in it to make a noticeable fire. now looking more closely you see a trail where you came from as you walked, light cart marks where these were hauled and dropped off. we are the first to trigger the trap.

history on the brand: when looking at this it was familiar for berridin/tsi. you recall that it has the symbol on the lightposts at the base. knowing this, berridin checks and finds a broken light crystal in them. 

nature check: can't quite tell how long they were brought, they couldn't have been here too long. 

what happened, why did the trap get set, for who.
