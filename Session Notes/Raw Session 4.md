We're still at the trap site.
It's evening now.
--
Nyx turns to group:
"so, the dustbreaker lighthouse constructed these and they were just sitting here?
one- these were put here as a trap for us
two- these were put as a trap for *anyone* and we just happened to stumble on it...
and why are they making these?
ellara?"
ellara: "no, i've never seen anything like this"
nyx: "looks like they were researching, and they're here"
ellara: "who's they"
nyx: "these things, were they put here to attack people"
ellara: "it seems clear they were put here to attack people"
nyx perception 15: it's not so much evidence but the lack of, you see wagon tracks but no wagon. there's no meri.
ellara to ysidor: is there any trace of your mentor here?
ysidor: 16 perception. looks around, you've wandered around camp. you've come across nothing of hers
"no, there's nothing to indicate she was here"
nyx: "we are going the right way, right?"
ysidor: "we are, but she wouldn't get injured or captured by these... i don't think she left the city"
berridin: "so this trap was probably not for her?"
ysidor: "she wouldn't have stealthed around this, she would have beat them"
nyx: we have nothing else to go on, so let's go back to the city like ysidor suggested
we will camp here for the night.
---
nyx picks up the light crystals (3), they are roughly fist sized and light despite their size (roughly like the star seeds in sailor moon in crystalline structure)
nyx: investigation 5. you see the crystals as dimly glowing.
---
we get back to Bastion City by nightfall and we see all the light crystal lights glowing. guards don't give much trouble.
ellara says we need to return the carriage.
she knocks.
same man who rented the carriage opens.
nyx: "we're here to return our carriage"
"everything seems fine"
ellara: what should we do instead
"get here earlier"
ellara: that's not up to us
---
ellara: "it's time for bed, perhaps tomorrow we should ask proctor edouard about those constructs"
nyx: "sure, be careful"
ysidor: "are you not worried for your safety, there's some dark magic going on"
ellara: "exactly, who better to ask"
ysidor: "if you respect him as your mentor then i can't say anything about it"
berridin: "let's head to you tomorrow morning"
nyx: "be aware if he says something bizarre, just be yourself and tell us what you learned, be yourself"
ellara: "will do, i don't know who else i would be"
nyx internally (this is not how he would have done this at all, but he's basically the sure, why not meme)
decided to meet at the same gate as last time outside the seminary
---
at this point nyx's house is a nest for tsi'nyra and the panther
---
morning: berridin/ysidor go get food. at this point the halfing enclave is familiar with ysidor the giant.
nyx/tsi'nyra: nyx makes another culinary adventure
---
ellara: morning prayers. she encounters proctor edouard.
after the prayers/meditative. 
"oh proctor eduoard i meant to reach out to you"
"what's up apprentice"
"i went to help reunite the goliatths for When the wandering ember finds again the hearth that first kindled it, both flame and forge grow the warmer, and the Light gains a steadier hue. we encountered some strange clockwork like constructs that seemed to be built by the lighthouse"
"what?? if i may"
sleight of hand 15 (to retcon having drawn them at the time), shows the sketch and gives it to him.
"you captured their insignia as well, and you say they attacked you"
"yes"
"duskbreaker lighthouse... i tried to warn the duke... sometimes the light can blind itself... they can be blinded by their own ambition... they should be serving the people, these are abomination-"
"they certainly felt that way"
"i assume your companions are also unscathed, how many were there"
"3, if my companions hadn't been battle hardened..."
"i must take this to the eulogia, were you able to reunite the goliaths"
"no, we saw no sign"
"i did release her and she was supposed to go home"
'this does not bode well... '
"what should we do next"
"this is beyond you... i believe you know the lighthouse and the eulogia have had a tense relationship, they say we stop their progress"
"someone must be taken to account!"
"and they will... i have a lot to think about, many letters to write and people to contact"
---
meet at the gates, ellara slightly delayed due to convo.
berridin and ysidor are worried and decide to go in.
they notice ellara come towards them
ysidor runs towards her and bear hugs here "i was so worried you weren't going to be ok"
ellara looks nervously around: "master ysidor you should be a little more careful"
ysidor: "you were late, you should be more careful, i'm your friend and want to protect you"
ellara: "you are very kind it's like you know the eulogia already"
he puts her down after they agree to go meet the rest of the group
ellara/berridin notices everyone stops looking at the group
reconvene at the gates
ellara recounts the discussion excitedly saying that it'll be investigated properly but mentions the proctor's worried the lighthouse might be involved with meri.
ellara insight 21: proctor seemed genuinely upset
---
berridin/nyx know lighthouse is not really open to the public.
tsi'nyra decides to use a spider familiar to investigate the lighthouse

ellara: but the lighthouse is one of the most secure buildings in the city
nyra: well i was going to use this spider
ellara: but the eulogia is going to investigate, shouldn't we wait... wouldn't it mess it up the proper process... (she's basically ignored)
stealth check for companion (to see if it can drop off the spider): 18. spider jumps on big kitty and it heads out, it knows to go back to nyx's place when done.
---
nyx: your spider friend knows to come back to my apt right? we should go back... to... it... (reluctantly realizing everyone would go and find out where it is)
ellara was a bit unconvinced but the idea of lunch sounded interesting
berridin notices the inside does not match the outside as it's much nicer than the outside.
main bedroom has a destroyed bed where nyra's companion curls up in.
nyx: leave the panther alone..
ellara makes a mental note of the place.
nyx makes a quiche lorraine.
berridin perception 10: don't notice anything out of the ordinary.
nyx is thinking this is why he didn't want to show people this place
ysidor: a good host would offer us a drink...
nyx: i just did!!
cooking rolls for nyx: dex - nat 1 - 4, wisdom - 16
nyx is so distracted by berridin and ysidor, things look weird, big chunks, not very appetizing but... it's delicious
ellara: your presentation is quite... interesting but it's quite good
---
tsinyra feels a tap on her neck, her friend's back.
saw a lot of metal, went into the basement, fairly deep, cold dark, more inscts and spiders... some noises it didn't quite investigate due to time and competitiveness between other insects... but it went underground a lot more than you'd think. there's depth to it.

berridin thinking: they're manufacturing something or... a prison. ellara how long do you think it'll take.
ellara: i assume it'll take a while it might even be escalated outside the province.
berridin: that'll take too long
ellara: the light that burns fastest is not the light that burns brightest

nyx to ellara: what is happening is that we will go investigate the lighthouse and find our way in to find evidence about meri... do you want to come along
ellara: i just don't understand how this would work
nyx: this sort of thing... i haven't done it specifically... i just do things like this... this is the only way to get headway with meri or we'll never hear back--
ellara: he will definitely get back to us, it might just take a while
nyx: he has no reason to, you're being is optimistic all you have is faith on him... but that's not evidence... that could be a problem for you 
ellara: i must pray on it.
nyx: you can also help without being directly involved
ellara: how?
nyx: idk.
ellara: i just need 17 minutes.
ellara religion check: 21. - as you meditate you hear the low noise outside the room and it fades again you hear that voice but not clearly. there is a sentiment. it is confirming that helping these people is the right path. that many questions will find answers in the light house. BUT it will not be easy. after sounds come back.
she goes back out and resolutely says she's in and needs to enter.
nyx: it would be good to have you there, just didn't want to force you.
ellara: i appreciate that.

next up Ocean's Eleven entry to the lighthouse!!
