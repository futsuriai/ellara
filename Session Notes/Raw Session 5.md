We are now deciding what to do about the infiltration.
deciding how to go in
should ysidor take off armor to stealth better?
disguises?
stake out the place, have ysidor bonk someone and go as them?

we have decided to scout a bit at first
Luck check: 60
we see 3 people leaving, with leather armor, swords at their waist

berridin will trail them stealth:19, they don't notice him

it's afternoon by now

berridin follows them into a bar, he decides to eavesdrop perecption check: 17. 
"these night shifts so boring, same thing every time, just monitoring the crystals"
"hey they pay us well"
"you did well with the poker game though?"
- seems like they slack off at their job, just griping

---
it's evening now
another group of 3 comes out, they have belts around them with different kinds of potions, a book on one of them, a hammer, tools, books
perecption ellara: 7/nyx:10, can't quite place what they are
we follow
stealth ellara: 7/nyx 15
they are walking, as they get to the end of the bridge, one splits off. the two are going to the pub
ellara wants to trail the guy that went off by himself
nyx does not want to leave her by herself
---
nyx sees them enter a bar
---
berridin: the guys have been drinking (berridin: i've also been drinking, con check: nat 20, perception with advatage: 16), 2 people walk in, groan at the sight of the soldiers and go to a different part of the bar. nyx follows in after.
nyx: roll perception 8. he doesn't notice berridin. 
now the new comers are ordering drinks. nyx (perception: nat 20) can hear them talking, but it's all very technical. roll dc 20 intelligence: 1. he notices they're the artificers but has no idea what they are saying.
---
ellara, as he turns the corner he turns back
"why have you been following me sister..."
"ellara, i had some question about herbs"
he reaches ou
"i'm more familiar with other biomatter"
talk about herbs and he tries some and recoils
she shows some herb combinations and expresses interest in his attire and items
persuation: 17
he scribbles an address, if you meet me here tomorrow at time tbd i
may i have your name: darius
i want to learn more about what you do
darius: i'm what you call an artificer, we take magic and technology and combine them.
ellara: eyes glittering, can anyone be one?
darius: yes, it would take many years of training 
darius: herbs a a bit old fashioned
ellara: herbs are more powerful than city folk think, perhaps i can change your mind on them
darius: sure thing kid.

--
more time
in the pub:
persuasion check as the guards are leaving to break the ice to pretend to be drunk: 10:
berridin:'it's been a long day after work"
guard: are you even old enough to work? oh sorry halfing.. .thought you wer a kid for a sec
berridin: *motions to the barkeep to order a round*
guards: well if the next round is on you... my husband won't be madder if i'm another round late...
berridid: where you coming from?
g: lighthouse
b: wooow, cool, what do you do?
g: we're guards.. just make sure people that shouldn't go in don't
b: my boss has been driving me nutty, any openings there?
g: the lighthouse is very peculiar... not everyone who applies gets a job... we used to be city guards, that's how we got in
b: do they do bg checks? 
g: yeah... they need referneces, they're not letting their secrets out
b: c'mon man, take me through what a day is like, better than what i'm going through
g: what is that?
b: ... working at a butcher shop, he makes me clean the slop
g: we mostly play poker, officially monitoring for alarms but seems like we don't do anything
b: are they watching who enters closely? 
g: no one can get into the lighthouse without the right pass... i don't think they're hiring a butcher any time soon
b: hopefully we're liking up soon
g: sure...? aron's gonna kill me.
b: - watches where they go - stealth: 16. (guard rolled a nat 1 - disadvantage cause drunk). they're splitting up. berridin follows the guy he was talking to, the drunkest one.  
insightt check 4: he thinks like, yeah i can fake this pass and fake in, can't be too hard
sleight of hand to pick pocket the guard: nat 20.
--took house keys, runestone stone/metal contraption (pass)
---
nyx follows one of the artificers
stealth: 16
woman looks at him: what do you want? you've been following me (shot him with something but missed)
nyx: i live over there
w: you were following me
n: well i got to go 
deception: 6
w: you don't live here. -whatever she shot you with she cocks it again
n: how do i get a job as a guard at the tower
w: be smarter than you

combat:
nyx: shoots her in the face with a crossbow:
roll to attack: 14 - miss he rolls away
-- she rolls 14, misses nyx
-- grabs him by hand, shocking grasp... 6 lightninig damage, can't take a reaction and runs 35 feet away
nyx: blessing of the raven queen to teleport within 15 feet. she goes to cast a shield, it breaks. 25 hits. 5 damage on her.
artificer woman: casting sanctuary on herself. wards herself until spell ends 1 min. then she RUNS 35 feet and screams. 
nyx: casts entagle, and runs toward her
a: rolls 4, she's restrained due to entagle.
nyx: moves in, tries to attack, wisdom save due to sanctuary: 21, success, 21 to hit, 4 points of damage.
a: entagle save 14: pulls out. she runs, opportunity attack, roll to hit nat 20. 12 points of damage. plants are diff terrain so she doesn't get too far.
nyx: wisdom 16 against sanctuary: 16. pass. he shoots her in the head.
a: looks him dead in the eye, reaches to the main causeway. dies.
nyx: pissed this happened because it shouldn't have. he checks for identification. 
he finds: a bunch of potions, spell book, tool kit, similar runestone as the other guard. takes everything including clothes.
this was kind of noisy. he hides the body. casts disguise self on it. deception check: 18. he hides the body.
The legend of the Jack the Rripper of Bastion City body count: 1
---
people meet back up.
berridin is so excited his plan went well.
stranger comes to the group (nyx in his disguise from hiding after his kill).
berridin explains
nyx: things... did not go to plan. I got the clothes and artifacts but she's dead... no one saw me... not happy about it. so... potentially a way in.
berridin: did you stumble on to her already dead?
nyx: if that lets you sleep better. while not like this i have had to kill before. ... i'm sorry... 
ysidor: berridin... get away from the bad man.
berridin: i didn't know killing was on the table like that... we should avoid that.
nyx: yeah... she knew right away i'm not the smoothest.
ysidor: to ellara: is murder. 
ellara can't even talk she goes to hide behind him.
ellara stutters out... : wh-why?
nyx: she was suspcious, attacked me first, i did say i was going in the same direction, not my best work.
berridin: ... after i PICK POCKETED the badge and sent him how to his husband (alive), also found this rune-stone. 
nyx pulls out his, the sigil is different but clearly they are siblings in terms of use.
--- 
berridin: ysidor/ellara maybe you can focus on restraining the guard? tsi'nyra maybe recon, i enter as the guard, nyx as the artificer. 
but the guard might not have a shift.
nyx will go as the guard. berridin will go as the guard.
---
nyx shows up. fairly open space, high ceilings, decorative. art deco. hard lines. two guards. behind there's hallways but you can't see. they all seem to be going to the right.
he looks, there's no way to not scan.
he walks through and beeps in. he goes through.
he goes to the right where everyone is going. 
he heads to security.
there's an empty seat... everyone else is seated, in front of some kind of inlaid panel with glowing runes.
he sits down like everyone else. 
"oh stanley you're working tonight? thought you were getting shitfaced"
n: "my better half said i needed to 'prove myself'"
"this isn't the first time you did this to aron, you have a drinking problem... and a gambling problem"
n: "would have preferred to have all these things hit me separately not at once"
"well, we're just waiting for the alarm to go off"
nyx notices that to go through doors they have to tap
---
early morning, shift has been a while
berridin he puts on the artificer's disguise (he had to remove blood from some of the items)
NYX you describe her: she's got somewhat curly hair brown, 5'7. slim. bookish. very serious face, doesn't smile. she had spectacles on. 

just sees guards, no artificers
"oh ms faberge, early to the labs again"
he looks at the guard with a disgusted face and says "always" and scans the rune.
"nice talking to you as always"
right or left. right is down, left is up.
he heads up stairs. it's a spiral. lots of windows. first/second floor above ground. he sees benches, lights, light crystals suspended. not really anyone there. the benches have contraptionshe doesn't recognize but they seem personalized. 
investigation check to look for names: 5, don't find the name there. 
intelligence check: 9.
he continues going up. 
"oh oh ms faberge didn't think you were coming early, thought you were not in today are you doing an inspection today?? "
berridin as faberge: "you should be ready for an inspection any day of the week" intimid: 21 
"y-yes, i'll come up and report"
berrdin: what's your name again
tingle: tingle
b: tingle, don't keep me waiting.
he continues walking up. at about the... 15th floor you stop. every floor up has fewer but more intricate benches. now there's doors and offices. he notices "michelle faberege". scans the rune, it opens.
he sees a desk, a wall with scrolls and tomes and a closed door. "director of research" was the title under the name. 
investigation check: nat 1
you don't understand ANYTHINg on the diagrams.
investigation 11. he sees some different materials. he's sign a light crystal in  alamp. he sees devices that look like the runestone but with different sigils, in different states of "completeness".  he takes one, it's warm to his touch.
the other name on the other door outside to the other lab is "director of relations: donnathan reeves"
he tries to scan the other door with his runestone. it rejects with a noise.
tingle:"m-miss faberge i'm here to report... i-i saw nothing"
"where's the report"
t:"i'm supposed to write this? i was going to present"
b: "you should have both, let's take it in my office"
he sits in the only chair in the office.
b: does the gendo ikari pose
t: you are the leading research in th..
b: mingle was it? i don't need teh flowery details just give the report
t: the transverse law with the magical componetns is rejecting but if you inject more power at the right time into the crystals we can make them into a power source, the issue in long term holding is, ... if you use a phosphorous component then these crystals are able to increase their capacities tenfold
b: seems right so far, what applications?
t: well i know there'd be the warforges but they had to be off and triggered, this would let them be active full time 24/7. or the lamp-posts you wouldn't have to recharge once a week, maybe once a year. haven't been able to do the trial runs.
b: can you give me the files for the warforged titan application?
t: i wouldn't have the files, didn't you work on this directly?
b: are you questioning me?
t: i'm only in second floor
b: who would have these files
t: beth. in engineering on the 10th floor. i didn't see her in yet. i don't know if you knew that because you always take the elevator.
b: keep it together.
t: usually you're talking to my boss's boss.
b: you have to be prepared, your manager will hear about it.
b: is dr..mr reeves in today?
t: no,no rumor has it he's in the capital speaking with the eulogians.
b: thank you... 
t: he's in ordonne, well, pharus the capital.
b; youre dismissed. anything else in your report?
t: i can tell you word for word if you need!!
b: no that's fine, you can go. 
she backs out and runs out and shut the door behind her.

ellara meeting with darius.
seems to be a residential place in the western edge of the city.
when she arrives she sees him, he's outside. 
"oh, i'm actually kind of surprised you came"
"why?"
"ooh sometimes eulogians... (quietly) - oh my colleague has a personal lab here but the door is locked and i don't see her, she's never late"
"your coworke--"
"technically higher up with a bad reputation but outside of work she's phenomenally intelligent"
"uhoeuh uao" flustered as she realizes
"honestly i need to go"
"she's not answering the door"
ellara: would she even have taught me
"she has a bad reputation but she's a fairly good teacher"
ellara: i wish i would have been able to meet her
"that's dark"
ell: because she's not here i mean.
"i can't help because i can't/don't want to break in"
ell: what were you working on
"a lot of the water purifacation on the east side is left to rot, we were looking into a purify water spell"
ell: that sounds like something everyone would support
"no, they don't want to put resources into it, it was a personal project... you must know how to purify water as a cleric, we wanted to do it perpetually, kind of like how mills work to use the water to power the spell, the problem is that crystals can only do one or other"
ell: could you not just different crystals to do different functions
"sorry i have to go"
ell: tell her i would love to meet her.. (sadly)
ell: before you leave is it possible to meet another time, i would love to learn more about artifcers
"the wailing pig, tuesday evening"
- she does some rituals for the dead in front of the house in lieu of the body as she doesn't know where it is
----
tsinyra/ysidor - hear fighting, things crashing out of a window, at the guard's house.
the guard smells like an alehouse
"rough night buddy"
ysidor: at rock bottom the best way up is by drinking, that's what we say in my village
"not like i can get in more trouble, aron already kicked me out"
y: "first drink is on me" (he had taken some money from nyx's who let it slide). 
they go to a nearby bar.
guard: thanks. (he downs half of it)
y: what happened?
g: you wokr, you go for drinks, you aven't been home in 24h, he yells, you smell like alcohol, he yells, he says you promised not to do this and you do and you're the worst person ever and you suck
y: are you married to this person?
g: not for long
y also chugs half his beer
y: you know, in my village, when a couple is going through it... we always say they should bring their troubles to the town square. and then we see who sides with who. and the winner gets to sleep with someone else as compensantion. i think you should attempt this, the goddess of love always delivers. one of you will find love.
g: you want one of us to be cucks?
y: i don't know what that means.
g: where the fuck are you from.
y is min maxing since he things orgies happen at the seminary so he's trying to fit in
g: goddess of love? what kind of heresy is this THE LIGHT
y looks at the ceiling: yeah there's lights
y: you know what always makes me feel better? a drinking contents
y 4 shots each.
guard passes out drunk.
y downs the remaining the shots, pats him "may love guide you"
----
back to guard scene
"stanley, your turn to patrol"
nyx goes out, doors in hallway say "recreation", "living space", "med bay"
he goes into recreation, plush leather chair, piano, fireplace, more doors in the back. walks through casually. artificers there they don't acknowledge him.
med bay: one person at a desk but no one else, there's some gloves.
heating: takes a quick look heat blasts him, turns back
mess hall, people eating
storage room: bunch of stuff lying around. bunch of stones. they're sending stones. stealth: 24. sleight of hand: 14. grabbed 5 without anyone seeing. 
perception: 16. people writing with a pen but when nyx went past he couldn't see anything on the sheet but the other person acted like they could read it.

he sees 10 of the warforged and a massive one. without touching or going, do i see any markings, no. he walks in, they are completely de-activated.
insight: 23, between everything you saw workingand the remarks about not being needed... these guys turn on if things get bad. the alarms would trigger them. 
he continues his rounds. 
he goes back to the empty beds.
they look up and go 
"can i help you"
nyx: thought i heard a noise
"no...?"
nyx: let me know
he goes back to his station.

guard: "so much fun isn't it?"

---
berridin-
what has ms faberge been up to.
he went further up, he scans to go in. stairs continue higher but he looks around this one.
large conference room but its swagged out.
he goes upstairs again, the stairs stop. "Advanced Research Laboratory". he scans to enter.

tall ceilings, glass everywhere. basically top of the tower basically. several floors high but one lab.

he scans the room to see what he sees, some people working here. they nod their heads at him. 
he casually walks through to see if anything matches the sigil in his pocket.
perception: 16. in the back you see a 4x size warforged. modern, clean, shiny. not old like the ones we fought. it's hunched over with panels open. 

"progress is going fine, ms faberge, should be done by the end of the week"
b: "are we on schedule"
"that's what i said"
b: "end of week si not necessarily schedule"

he sees things similar to the artifact he took but they are smooth here. there's other warforged more similar to the size we fought but maybe less actively being worked on. they all look like upgraded versions though.

who wants to appease her: insight: 4... everyone wants to appease you
he sees someone with a clipboard.

b: "you there"
clipboard: "some lower levels may have a breakthrough, could be operational, with the new tech could be 24/7"
b: can you give me a report on the last test
c: alpha/beta/gamma all tests and motor functions and command retention passed. concerns with 24/7 operation. we have been proposing a command source, as you pointed out weaknesses are it could be stolen or interfered with. we are looking into autonomous designs but there's ethical concers and feasibilty as the tech is new... i know there's been some magic but we'd need more resources for wizards that are more technical. if we could caputre the command spells better it would probably work better. 
b: have there been more field test planned?
c: hm? oh yeah, those models, someone should be bringing them back soon. as far as i know the commands were aggressive but they were off road so only animals should have been affecetd. we'll do a full diagnostic report once they get back.

seems like faberege gave the command to run the test but it came from higher up.

b: be sure to send it when it's ready.
c: i know the lightkeepers will want to know the results.
b: thank you
c goes back to work

he goes up another floor.

up to know it almost felt industrial revolution with bright aesthetic. this is old school. there is parchment, handful of people, big space, bookshelves with tomes and scrolls. work benches but more magical. 

"oh, ms faberge do you have business with us today"
b: "i was just looking to double check something with one of your colleagues, who's working today"
"you were studynig the other day for your pet project... uhm... lex hasn't reported in today, was he expecting you? lex was helping becaus... something with the transfiguration of the elements... would one of the other wizards be able to help... no lex was the specialist i could.. hm.. i could send him a message"
b: "if you wouldn't mind"
insight: 10. staring off into the distance.
"lex definitely not coming in today, don't know why someone respons in the middle of sex but... you pay us for consulation we're not at your beck and call like the rest of them"
"lex said he'll see you tomorrow morning, he'll go to your office, is there any volume of arcana you can help yourself"
b: "thank you i appreciate it, can you direct me to them"
"uh.. there, index cards are in the center"
b: this is what lex was working on?
"oh, he won't want you there but.. he needs to clean up, whatever i don't care go to his desk"

index cards->trying to understand what the project is. 
perception 15. all of these are magical scrolls/tomes. full on wizard sorcerors in here. all magic tomes/scrolls/etc 
arcana: 8. you're holding something very magical (re the artifact from the office), it feels like.. you know when you cast a spell, that tension the second before you cast it. you can tell it's single use. 

he scans lex's desk, it's a mess.
perception: 2... nope. 

he goes to the top to look over the city. only other thing that has a similarly imposing presence is the ducal palace.
---
nyx
can he go safely check out the gloves, are the gloves still there?
it would be suspicious to go. 
as your character you don't know what's in the lab, you don't have security clearance.
insight: 11. nothing.
he goes back to the guard room before the end of their shift and leaves. `
---

everyone meets back up at nyx's house.

nyx: what'd you learn berridin? 
berridin: first off, didn't kill anyone, you?
nyx: me neither
nyx takes out the sending stones.
ellara looks at interestedly. berridin runs to the other side of the room and whispers into them.
berridin tells everyone what happened.
- we have confirmed the dawnbreaker lighthouse was involved in the attack we had and they're manufacturing the robots there
- they are trying to infuse magical spells into the warforged titans we don't know why yet
- and he has the device 
ellara learned:
- michelle was a kind soul
- the water system filtration project
nyx learned:
- sending stones
- tours of facility
- saw the warforged
- couldn't see the main lab
- invisible ink (?)
ysidor:
- prevented the guard from going to work
- he thinks he helped their marriage

unclear what next steps are but we've seen some new threads to pull on
we know there's more to the labs in the basement
don't know where meri is 
we have the director of research pass and her likeness
