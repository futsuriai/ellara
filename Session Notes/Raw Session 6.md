recap:
as the duskbreaker came under our suspicion... we followed some ppl, got their passes. nyx resorted to violenc. berridin using clever wit and took advantage of a drunk person to pick their pocket. given what happened the group decided nyx would be the guard, berridin to the form of micheelle faberege director of research at the lighthouse. during their shifts, he went to the upper levels and interacted with lex who is a contractor. we found 1) the warforges are coming from the lighthouse, and 2) new modern ones were being worked upon. michelle was also working with lex on a solution to have a long term power source that would let them operate independently. lex is part of wizards contracted by the lighthouse. nyx saw some interesting things but didn't get into the main room. but did see stored warforges. he saw mysterious gloves. and invisible ink being used and he managed to snatch 5 sending stones. also learned the ruling council of the lighthouse are the lightkeepers.
meanwhile ellara met with darius at michelle's workshop, michelle did not show up. found out she was working to provide non-contaminated water for the east part of the city. 
meanwhile ysidor and tsinyra kept an eye on the kicked out guard that nyx was maskerading as.
-------- 

nyx berriding (histor/insight 10/10) - not quite sure what they're up to with the warforged. berridin would see that the new ones can't be deployed/be independent yet but could be used for short bursts.

nyx: i wasn't able to really do anything besides the things i was able to see. when doing rounds i *was* alone but in the guard rooms there's multiple people. no points with lessened scrutiny.
berridin: it sounds like we need to get into that basement area, do you think michelle's pass would work? 
nyx: yeah, probably. would need a backup plan to get out.
berridin: maybe we try one more day as michelle before they catch on? - he shows the experimental runestone to the group to see if we can tell
arcana checks: nyx 14, ellara 12, ysidor 1 ("yes, it's a stone. - he shakes the stone and asks if it knows wheer meri is")
ellara/nyx can sense there's magic but not enough to understand it, schools of magic are too different. ellara is more used to divine magic, nyx is more used to nature but it doesn't vibe with this. you know enough to know you can't tell and it's beyond our ability.
berridin takes the stone back from ysidor. 
it's evening at Nyx's.
berridin will try going in again the next day.
team decides to test the sending stone.
berridin: <can you hear my thoughts>? 
no answer
they are basically small walkietalkies. 
ellara tests whether the stones need intent. to send they need a kind of activation by touch, basically push to touch. now she wants to test how quiet she can be if the stone is in her pocket and have it be picked up. it won't pick up normal volume conversation unless it's loud.

others will monitor the outside in case there's anything weird

-- next day -- 

nyx goes in as guard stanley, he goes down. he sits at the same desk 
"he kicked you out?"
nyx: "i dnn't want to talk about it"
"don't drink so much? at lesat you don't at "
---
ellara at lab, it's off a main street, not that dingy, sort of residential.
perceptoin: 17 - you see what appears to be a normal door. a few windows with closed curtains, very ordinary from the outsie.
she tries to open, it doesn't open. 
there's some gaps in the door.
she looks around and wild shapes into a spider.
goes through the keyhole. it's dimly lit but as a spider it's not so bad.
mostly a table/workbench. different components that she can't identify. some tomes. and handwritten. 
what she can read: confirms what darius was talking about, a technology to use light crystals but they have a difficulty with receiving power while using some, recharging while exhausting is hard
insight nat 20. something dawns on her. the problem with the warforged that michelle was talking about with lex for the warforged is the same problem with the water source, so they have the same solution...
she looks for notes about how she's thinking about the problem. michelle does have concerns about the applications of the tech. ellara gathers for the power of the technology but sees the danger.
there is a line that strikes her: "how much more blood will this cost"
---
berridin:
performance 16. he walks down without issues.
he walks straight to the main line. big vault door. he tries to scan his runestone it pauses. then the mechanism turns and opens. before him. it opens into a cavernous space. there are a few other artificers working. there is akind of  amain desk in the middle and it overlooks something in the middle. he can't quite see what.

"dr faberege, we didn't expect you tday"
b: "this is a surprsie inspection"
"oh, oh, were the notes not sufficient, we're still working on the subject"
b "i would like an oral report"
he sees the form in the center, it looks familiar at the center. taller than normmal. grey skin. 7/8 foot tall, ponytail, body seems unconscious.
"eulogians sent us this subject. as you knowlight crystals are forged from shadowed ones"
b: "what's your name again, doesn't matter"
dawn: "dawn"
b: "who sent this to us form the eulogians"
dawn: "as you know it's donnathan, weren't you there?"
b: "how about you assume less and ansnwer"
24 intimidation
d: yes maam, per usual he hands it off per protocol, anything from him is into your custody, direct or not.  as i was saying we are working on the synthesis of light crystals. as creating synthetic specimens is much more powerful and can hold more powerful magic.
b: do these require the subject to be alive?
d: well, at initiation but it will consume the subject.
b: what stage is the subject at?
d: we've only managed to get to 15% over the last day, normally we'd be at 100%, it would seem shadowed flora are easier to process than fauna
berridin insight/history on shadowed flora: 8 - no idea what that means
d: about to use a higher pressure, we think it'll destabilize their form. it seems tehse stone goliaths take more properties. 
b: is this one still alive.
d: yes.
b: what's today's test? 
d: the furnace will induce high heat/pressure (similar to synth diamonds ooc).
b: we're going to need to put a pause, this is coming from the higher ups. 
d: will do...  *motions to them to cut it 
d: if we can't continue then i guess it's an early lunch
b: excuse me it helps when the specimen is alive and vital before the tests right?
d: we haven't had this much difficulty, usually it's been heavily sedated so functioning is tbd. but to be frank they're shadowed.
b: we'll try something else, can we stop the sedation?
d: this subject is violent, i would not recommend it.
b: we do have upgraded shackles to contain the subject.
d: this might introduce contamination, i suppose subject can be moved to the medical bay... is that everything dr? we can proceed with your instructions?
berridin wants to choose the 'worst' shackles.
perception 2. he has no idea how to choose.
he tells them to proceed. 
he walks a bit closer to the specimen. 
--- 
nyx: 
he hears the need for 2 guards to move the specimen in the main room.
the guard capitain "stanley, cooper, go"
see michelle faberege, and the artificers. and the unconscious form of meri shackled and on a stretcher. "take her to the medical bay"
nyx: "understood" and does it.
don't see the gloves on the table
artificer: "the subject... i'm supposed to do what with it?"
nyx was told to stop sedation and keep the specimen alive
nyx: instructions to cease sedation but the shackles will be in place
artificer: *eyes rolled* oh great no sedation, this will turn out great. 
as nyx leaves he sees them tend to meri 
nyx goes back to main room
nyx: faberege, it's done
berridin nods
berridin takes a closer look through the room, perception 13, everything stands out but he can't quite make sense of it. massive machine with piping, the incubator, work benches. notes around that describe the last few days with the issues with processing this exact specimen. investigation dc 15: roll 8. nothing else found.
artificers want to be dismissed.
berridin asks dawn: can you review the proper procedure for disposal of previous specimens?
d: well, once they're processed into light crystals they're sent upstairs to be used in current projects.
b: how many successful runs have we had?
d: this is our first what we would call, fauna, previously the flora organic specimens... there were two of them. previously worked on light crystals found around in shadowed ruins, naturally processed from the remains of shadowed. it's hard to purify them due to cross contamination... we were fortunate to find the floral bio specimens, i know you weren't fully for this as they were somewhat humanoid but all in the name of the light house..
b: yes, all in the name of the lighthouse. you all may leave. 
he's now alone. 
berridin speaks on the sending stone and asks ysidor if he's seen the guard.
---
ysidor had knocked on the guard's door. the partner answered.
"hello?" (aaron)
y: yes, hello. i'm a friend of stanley's 
a: ok. *his face drops*
a: how much does he owe this time
y: owe? he doesn't owe anything
a: you're not one of his gambilng friend coming to collect?
y: no, i'm a bar friend
a: o so you're one of the reasons he doesn't come home
y: no i tell him to come home but he hasn't
a; well hes' not welcome anymore
y: can you mend you're relationship
a: well maybe if he stopped drinking and gambling
y: what would stanley need to do to be forgiven
a: beg on his knees and never drink another drop of liquour
y: i can handle that
a: sure thing
y: he'll be back before the end of the day and i want you to give him one more chance
--
he goes to the bar stanley is at. 
stanley is drink in hand, out of it.
y taps stanley on the shoulder
s: aren't you that guy from yday
y: i think i can save your marriag
s; it's over, it's dead, going to drink
y: what if i told you i can get your marriage back within the hour
s: what are you gonna do, aaron won't talk to me
y: i just need to accept my helping hand
s: are you coming on to me
y: no, that would be innapropriate you are married
y: stanley' i think that if you just allow me to speak sacred words to you for an hour
s: what kind of eulogian are you
y: <oh yeah not my village> .. i'm the kind who helps others
s: whatever can't hurt, go for it
y: insight dc 18 check: roll 21. he speaks his Atonement ceremony (action)
s: no no, i shouldn't drink, maybe you're right i should stop.  - he gets up and leaves
y: go stanley, run to aaron

--- loop back to berridin's message --

ysidor:  "berridin" (confused how he's hearing it)
berridin: touch the stoneee
ysidor: berridin? are you in here?
berridin: i'm here buddy buddy. 
ysidor: i'm good how is the stone, is it small in there or perfect for your size
xberridin misinterpreting: yeah it's roomy here
ysidor: wow
b: i think i found your mentor
y: you found meri? can i come over
b: not right now we need to find a way to free her
y: so should i bust down the front door
b: no no
b: did you run into the guard at all?
y: i fixed their marriage
b: amazing, nice job

----
ellara: nat 20 investigation.
you see a second set of notes. the diagram that you see is very familira. the second sigila is the one on berridin's expiremental rune. it's about uisng them like scrolls for casting spells. it's for emergencies, dimension door.
--
berrdin tells the team we found meri, she's sedated but no more meds, in the med bay. need to find a way to get her out. 
ellara: do you know how long she'll be unconscious
berridin: she's probably quite resilient like ysidor.
berridin: there might be a back door.
ellara sheepishly: i think the rune you found might be a way to trigger dimension door.
berridin: would you know how to trigger it?
ellara: (from the notes and evasively) i think you just need to push some magic into it and it'll trigger. 
ellara intelligence check 5 - does not think of a particular plan
ellara: tsi'nyra how strong is your panther
tsinyra: it could hold an individual.

berridin: insight check: 12. he's streetwise enough to know as soon as the door is cast the jig is up.
--
ellara she hears a noise at the door as if someone is at the door. she had taken another prototype spell rune but it was uncharged. before that she had taken careful notes and drawings in her notebook of anything that looked interesting.
someone opens the door, darius, he's flustered.
darius: shit she wasn't home, fuck fuck fuck. this is not good they said she was at the light house but that's impossible, i need to retrace her steps, damn it she would have... wait.. wait..  \
- he panicks
d: fuck fuck, i have to report this. he leaves after 10 mins. 

she changes back and reports that someone is on their way to report she's missing.
---
berridin walks to the medical bay.
"oh i assume it was you that ordered the specimen to be brought here"
b: yes, can i see it?
"by my calcs the sedation should wear off in an hour but have at it"
b: can you make sure we have the latest sedatives on hand in case we need them?
"yes they are already here"
b: there's actually another one in the armory, new formula
"...of course ms faberege" and leaves
now berridin is alone in the med bay. 
b: ysidor tell me when you're close enough to run in front of the lighthouse.

berridin executes. THE PLAN.

berridin channels his magic into the rune, he feels the spell in his hand he knows he must touch meri and think of where he wants to go. he does and thinks of the front of the door. they instantly show there.
tsinyra sees this. 
a call into the guard office.
ms faberege is missing
the captain says shes there. he gets reprimanded.
he commands to search the premises immediately.
berriding/tsi/meri/panther. ysidor on the other side of the bridge. 
tsinyra sees that. trying to lift meri onto the panther.
ysidor picks up meri and fling her on his shoulder
berridin as feberge, tsinyra. they BOOK it.
tsinyra gets on her panther and starts scouting ahead.
berridin follows ysidor and changes his disguise to a different human. 
he tries to cast an illusion spell of 
- hear an alarm echo out of the tower -
tsinyra survival check 13. leading the way.
nyx is commanded to look around the basement. stealth 24. he zips out through the front door in the confusion. 
he changes his disguise to a random person. 
tsinyra decides they should exit the city. 
nyx checks on the sending stone as he has no idea what's been going on, "what's been going on"
berridin huffing: we're running outside, the guards have been alerted
nyx: i'm already out, do not go back to my place
tsinyra has been following the rooftops on her panther
nyx: where should we meet, where are you heading?
tsi: outside the cityyyy
nyx: that's huge...
tsi: there's an old growth tree outside the city
nyx: we meet at the mangled tree
tsi: it's not mangled, sir
ysidor athletics check 17 he's keeping up with the panther mostly
ellara relaxedly takes a carriage to the eastern end of the city
get dropped off at the chapel in the east and makes her way to the tree after

---
it's night time by the tree.
the team debriefs.
ysidor medicine 12.
meri is breathing slowly.
ellara 19 medicine. know she just needs to rest. and tells ysidor.

berridin explains everything, "tehy're turning shadowed into light crystals. like meri, their essences into light crystals."
ellara: but that's not possible light crystals come from the mines
nyx; do you have proof of this.
berridin: the artificers told me, first they used shadowed flora.
tsinyra insight check 6 (pass) she realizes her actual form, she could be flora. she has two missing siblings. two that were experimented on but only she realizes. she says nothing for now.
nyx looks at her, tsi emotion shows on her face, she's too young to hide it  nyx insight: nat 20 
nyx clocks something happened, he's not sure what
b: mines were on shadowed ruins, that's the precedent for it.
b: i also found out, ellara, sorry but they said meri was handed over by the eulogians working with donnathan reeves
ellara: that can't be proctor eduoard wouldn't lie to me.
b: perhaps it's just some of them we need to follow up.
ellara: maybe we need to go ask him because this can't be true.
ysidor hand on war pick: yeah maybe we should go
ellara looks shocked: no, he did not do this
ysidor: well he didn't do it personally but allowed
ellara; i don't think so
ysidor: well your religion preaches kindness, there was no kindness done to her
ellara this was not the work of eulogia
nyx puts a hand on her shoulder, she immediately steps out of it
berridin: ysidor, meri, they only got 15% they said she was fighting the entire time
y: of course she'd be fighting that's who she is (tear in his eye)

starry skies near a wizened tree. lots of revelations this day.
