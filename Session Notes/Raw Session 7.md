Session starts not to far from the city on a "beaten" road near the gnarled old tree. it's around 8-9pm our time. it's dark.

nyx tries to sense if things are safe near the tree, survival roll 7, adrenaline still running through him, fight or flight so he can't really tell. 

ellara casts goodberry and force feeds meri to give her nourishment.

ysidor perception 17, he notices some ruckus in the city but doesn't see anyone.

nyx: let's get out of here, need to get somewhere

ellara: does anyone know if there's cover around here? 

ysidor survival 18, he remembers that an hour-ish away there's an old barn that didn't seem in use, it's in bad shape, he lets the team know: when travelling to the city i saw an abandoned building north from here around an hour away. I don't trust that place (looking back at the city)

ellara survival 9: attempts to hide our tracks but it's not the best it fails. 

barn is old, some gaps, dilapidated.

we go in. it smells a bit. rotten hay, musty. spider webs. maybe some movement for little critters.

nyx to ysidor: should we do anything with meri.

ysidor: no, i think i'll take the first watch. 
- he uses lay on hands on her to be over cautious

ellara: i want to look around the perimeter
- when she's out she does find familiar covertly to summon an owl and asks it to patrol and let her know if anything happens

nyx goes out, perception 6, too much adrenaline, too focused to notice
--- 

how is mental state? (not spoken) 
- ellara is torn, happy they saved meri, confused about the involvement of the eulogia, distressed about the murder as she never experienced 
- ysidor happy they found her, but she looks different. village always said city is dangerous, he's mad they were right
- berridin shaken up about how meri was being treated and the implications for other subjects, he arcana checks the empty dimension door rune, 10, it feels dormant now, there's still a light crystal powering but it doesn't hum alive anymore. it's "waiting". it's built in such a way that it does something but it's not doing it now.
- nyx is so used to doing his bounty hunting with no care to cost, he's never had anyone react to how he does it. first time in a long time he feels bad about the murder, grappling with the clash of how this group reacts to what he does. He has no real jobs lined up and wants to see where this goes even if he's not directly connected

long rest

no news from the owl familiar

ellara wakes before dawn to do her morning prayers
ysidor is a country boy and wakes early
nyx also up early to keep watch
berridin sleeps in

ysidor goes to tend to meri, her lilac eyes open: little hill, didn't think i'd see you again
ysidor just starts crying
meri: you were always such a crybaby
y: i was so worried, didn't know anyone, you were there but weren't there, i'm just so happy that you're alive
meri: it'll take more than that for those city folk to get rid of me
y still sobbing loudly enough to wake berridin
meri: have you been doing your training each day 
y looking down sheepishly: of-of course i have, let me introduce you to my friends... nyx he's a scary dude from the city, ellara is a very sweet person and this is berridin a child left to his own devices in the city.
meri looks around and takes a deep breath
y: and this is tsinyra (whispered to meri...) i don't know if she's human or not but she has a nice cat
meri: nice to meet you all, hopefully he hasn't made much trouble for you all. i assume you got me out of that forsaken contraption.
the group assents.
ellara: do you need food or tending to
meri: oddly i'm not as hungry as i'd expect but need to take it easy.
ellara: do you wish to go back to your village or perhaps file aformal complaint with the duke
m: the duke won't do anything for us, we're shadowed... little hill they will continue with that, they do not care what we want, we're left to fend for ourselves, no one in the city will help.
y: what DID lead you to come to the city
m: you know, little hill, they want to start a mine in our part of the mountain to find their light crystals... they were going to cut our own access and force our people to mine. eulogians tried to smooth things over.
ellara: what does smooth things out mean
m: they want to bring the light of eulogia and the empire to our people.. i tried to petition and was arrested on sight. then i was in jail, then a eulogian/priest, then attached to the machine doing whatever they were doing...
ellara in a scard voice: what did that priest look like
m: middle aged, <she describes proctor eduard>
ellara: i jsut don't understand, i can't believe he would do this
m: what do you mean that's what eulogians do to us shadowed
ellara: that's not what doctrine teaches, that's not what we do
m just sighs as if she doesn't want to get into it: little hill, i've been gone too long, you've been gone... i know our folk are pretty sturdy (and she laughs to herself) but they still need our help. 
y: sounds like i need to go back to my village everyone... i know there's things you might have questions about in the city but my duty is to my village first and foremost.
ellara: i must confront proctor eduard, there's no way he knows what's happening in the lighthouse. and we can't let them keep dragging innocents into that experiment.
intellingence nat 1 ellara: she stays quiet. and doesn't think of an argument.
y to meri: don't you think if we deal with the issues in the city we'll deal with the problem at the source... and the village would be safer.
m: my dear dear ysidor... hir doesn't hold power everywhere, and many in the city are deaf to her calls... trust me when i say this... there is nothing in our power we can do. even if we met the duke we would not be able to convince him, they do not care for us. as strong as you and i are we are nothing for whatever devices and powers they are doing. 
nyx: we can either address this issue and try to stop it from happening further OR 
m: i will always let little hill follow his heart, but my duty is to Hyrta (the name of their village)
nyx: or we follow to your village and the threat will always remain
nyx insight 21 - he's worked in bastion city, he's worked with various shadowed communities but also the elite. the elite didn't care how the job got done, just that it was. they pay people like him to get it done. there is, to a degree, what they want they get. he might get back and be given a job to find meri.
he thinks about this... and decides to tell the group: "honestly, if i go back to the city and do nothing, there is a high likelihood that the elite will ask me to go collect you, i'm in a position where i don't think i can do that... i wouldn't watn to, you wouldn't want me to... so i think i will go with ellara to see if we can stop this from happening."
berridin goes up to meri: madam, i am the one you gripped you tight and pulled you from perdition. i am your knight in shining armor. i rescued and i'd love to offer my assintance in procuring your home.
meris face turns to ysidor like -is this guy for real-: rambunctious are you, little hill thinks you're a child, maybe my fault... he's not to worldly, i would gladly take your assisstance. 
ysidor to meri: my duty is to our village, i won't be able to rest until the village is safe from those people
nyx to meri: look, if we do split up, we do have sending stones and we can stay in touch if need.
m: any communication.. the marvels of city technology... but it's a long travel.
e
ellara angrily: master ysidor, you saw what they were doing, you can't buy your family's safety with innocents lives.
m: oh youth to be hopeful, by what power do you hold child that you can turn the tides... little hill has all the freedom to choose as his heart dies. if 
ellara: if he wants to save his village he has to stop what is happening here. you did not see what we fought what will be coming. you may not follow the light of eulogia but you are on the same path in your own way.
m: i did not see them, but you did not suffer having your life force drained from you. everything becomes paler. do not tell me what i do not know. i will not be cruel to you as his friend. you are not shadowed, you don't know the cruelty of your city. the light is too blinding. don't try to educate me. what can you change that  has not in centuries
ellara crying: i don't know what happened centuries ago, but i know what we saw and if they finish that research no village will be safe
nyx: look, they experimented on you to see if you could be turned into a light crystal. just to see if they could us shadowed like us (hood reveal) as a common energy source. they will find others. i don't want to be a light bulb.
meri: i do not begrudge you your path. do not begrudge mine.
nyx: understood... if we find information and we require more help to do something about this. can we reach out to you. 
meri: i will not abandon my village but i can provide what guidance i need. it is the duty of the elders but we can't fight your battles for you. my heart says to protect my village. whatever aid i can give without jeopardizing my village i will give do not think me cruel.
nyx in exchange we will keep you abreast of what we find, i hope nothing comes to your village
m: time has taught me different, the engines of the empire are not slowing down
berridin was holding on to meri's hand: now now my dear. 
meri moves her hand away
berridin lays his hand on ysidor: ysidor, i understand your trepidation, but i think our new friend needs you.
ysidor to meri: i understand my duty to the village, but i know Hyr would not want me to abandon those in need when they are in front of me. i will go to the village but only in a month's time after i have resolved the situation here. 
- he gives meri his sending stone
ysidor: i hear these things have a mini version of you or us inside to talk. i will make my way immediately if needed. 
meri: my sweet sweet little hill, follow Hyr, i know you hear her as well as i do and sometimes she chooses different paths for us. halfing are you still accompanying me?
he's getting his stuff ready.
meri: i hope you can keep up i am in no shape to carry you.
berridin: it's ok i've been known to carry larger women. 
ysidor grabs berriden potato sack style: young one, it's too dangerous, you can come with me when i go in a month. right now the road is no place for a child to be on their own.
berridin is thrashing. 
m: you do realize your friend is not a child?
nyx: we tried.
m: little hill never changes, good heart.
ysidor doesn't really hear this.
m: he's a little stubborn like stone. just watch out for him he's a little gullible. he thought a mountain lion was a pet.
nyx: to be fair... <points at the panther>
ysidor says good bye.
berridin screams out "remember me" he casts a flying kiss at her
meri grabs it without looking
ellara gives her a good berry and apologizes for her outburst
m: i know the light is bright and we don't see eye to eye. it may be heresy to you but even hyr can even be found in the light. i know youth and concern is what drove you. do not let your faith blind you. if you stare too long at light it will blind you.
ellara nods sniffingly
m: little hill i will see you in two months time. i will use this stone if need be. <to group> but do watch out for him. little one <at berridin> if you do make it to the village i can show you the true meaning of Hyr.
berridin: til the next time.
meri walks off
---
ellara: now we should head back and confront proctor edward.
ysidor: that works
nyx: i can find things out discreetly but i won't be able to be the face of interactions, i'm here to support. well ellara, we're here to help what do you want to do?
ellara: i literally just said we need to talk to proctor edward
nyx: all of us?
ellara: yes
berridin: we need to observe how the lighthouse responds to meri's disappearance.
ellara: proctor edward will know what to do next if we talk to him properly
nyx: maybe... but if he is implicated, and i know you don't like this... that we he won't let us leave but that's a risk. we still need to split up and hedge our risk.
ysidor: i'd like to speak to this proctor, this eduard - he touches the warpick on his side.
berridin: there's also donnathan reeves.
ellara: if i remember correctly donnathan was in charge of liasing with the eulogia, that's just another point for talking to the proctor.
berridin: how would you want to set up the meeting? bearing in mind that he could be involved with this
ellara: i think i can just ask for a meeting with friends, i don't think he knows the truth of what's going on
berridin: you know you're my first love, but your mentor has hurt my second love. 
ellara: i don't know what to make of that
berridin: we might need to bring back moose, we should be careful about showing a goliath through the city.
---
group starts heading back to the city. as we approach the gates. we notice something new.
we see a newer looking warforged. inactive. at the gate. 
---
owl sees that people mostly just walk through, confused. no obvious check point or questioning.
---
we go through and there's another warforged on the other side of the gate, also inactive. back in the eastern side of the city. it's late morning.
ellara wants to go set up a meeting, she decides to head back to the seminary.
she notices two active modern warforged outside the lighthouse. she sending stones that info.
she gets there around lunch, towards the end. she goes to the mess hall.
in the distance she sees proctor edward talking to someone.
she grabs food and sits down close to them.
edward: acolyte ellara come here here, i didn't see you at morning mass i want to intro to someone
lanky man, intentionality of bed hair, fairly proper suit, well tailored clothes
e: this is an esteemed colleague donnathan reeves, director of relations at the lighthouse.
