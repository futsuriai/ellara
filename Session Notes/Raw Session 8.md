picking up: ellara was in front of donathan reeves.

"oh it's a pleasure to meet you, what brings you"
"oh eduoard, an old friend, met his niece, empress consort lyssandra, in pharos... i like to say public relations for the duskbreaker lighthouse, i act as liason between impreial family, nobility and eulogians and i've worked closely with eduard as he sees the benefit of the technology we're doing"
ellara nat 20 history history check: 
rumors, she knew proctor eduoard was the 5th son of some nobility. fairly large family, middle ranking. higher middle but 5th son, no hope of anything. over time learned he's 5th son of previous marchioness of marchenbau, a march in the imperial province of boixden. his brother (eldest) inherited, his nephew's daughter (grand-niece, not niece) married into the imperial family as the empress consort. she knew he came from a very powerful family and would have put the math together on his connection to the imperial family, maybe looked up the genealogy at some point. 
donathan: "just wanted to stop by to thank eduoard before stopping to see his grace (the duke)"
ellara: "proctor eduoard, comes from such distinguished family i do hope i have not offended you"
proctor: mother put me here and i find fulfillment in putting the light into the next generation, director reeves is good at socializing
ellara: i would never be able to either, my tongue would get me in trouble around such distinguised ppl
reeeves: being a 2nd child myself, i had all the tutors in the world, and torchlight college, my parents sent me there, that's where i met valeria, i meant his grace. my family has known for our wines, my brother is the count of sommeil (county in vasselia south west, known for its wine). 
eduoard: oh yes yes, director reeevs. or should i say viscount donathan.
reeves: now, now, you know how much i hate my title outside court 
ellara tries to half bow
reevnes: i prefer not to sit on titles, useless around most folks outside of courts.
ellara: i understand director lux reeves
reeves:eduoard eduard, do they not teach manenrs, lux... if anything it would be lord sommeil.. in the future it seems it might help, marquis and below it would be lord lady or lux, lord reeves or lord sommeil. alternatively viscount reeves. ellara was it, if you're talking to emperors
ellara waving away: i don't think i'll be talking to such important people
reeves: i'm sure you weren't expectating, i haven't seen valerian in a while. and i really do need to give my greetings.
insight 12: eduoard is not hiding anything when donathan says valerian, his face squishes. it was a very informal way to refer to grand duke.

ellara: proctor eduourd i hope i did not offend your guest,
eduarad: very little will fluster him, if anything the lack of formality pleases him
ellara: i had some questions, but maybe not in the mess hall.
-go to office, she's been before
piles of papers, organized, there is a light crystal lamp. shelving with neatly organized books. 

ellara: were you able to bring up the issue of the goliath with director reeves?
eduoard: yes, yes, donnathan said he'd look into it. he doesn't necessarily deal with it day to day and just came back and will go to the ducal palace for a few days as he's wont to do. it'll take.
ellara: i got worried you were not who you seemed but i'm glad you are who you seemed. (some discussion about the denmother and her scrolls full of intrigue)
eduouard: i do not make my birth public but i am the proctor now. it is part of the light to question. that is the path of the light. and again the denmother, we are all allowed our own little indulgences. these processes take long, the nobility takes long. this is why i was not born for these. much happier 
ellara: the path of the light may not be simple but at least it's more straightforward.
eduoard: it is much harder if you have not been born into it. they were born doing that.
ellara: oh perhaps that's why the path is easy for me. but i have met some poeople not born into the path and have struggled to have my words reach them.
eduoard: while we can light a room, they must choose it. they must take that first step. continue doing what you are. however, sometimes you find success in those that choose
ellara: d-do you trust direct reeves.
eduourd: to be frank he is a man bound by ambition and his own loyalties. i trust him to do what he will always.

nyx's apartment:

berridin napping with memories of meri.
nyx takes out the sending stone to see if ellara is done.
nyx: i think i'll reach out to ellara.
ellara hears the stone. 
ellara: yes, i was able to talk to proctor eduourd. fantastic news he is who he said he was and we can trust him.
nyx: any other details
ellara: o-oh he was talking to director reeves, it might just take a while to get details. 
nyx: thanks good job, are you safe
ellara: of course i'm safe, the seminary is a safe place
nyx to his room: any other questions for her?
nyx: in terms of next steps, what should we do
ellara: he's following up on it, it may just take time.
nyx: we could be waiting 2-3 years.
ellara: i'm sure it would not be 2 years, he would have mentioned if it would take that long.
nyx: alright so what do we do?
berridin wakes up: how's ellara did she realize her mentor is a crazy person

ellara: master berridin, with all due respect perhaps you need to talk to nyx, i will talk to you all tomorrow. - puts her stone away
--
berridin we neeed to keep monitoring the lighthouse to see the reaction to the lighthouse
nyx we need to keep monitoring the lighthouse, ellara is not going to ask her superiors the hard questions, she's never had to do that... i'm glad she did it, but we're kind of back to square one. i think she's not happy with what you said, berridin.
berridin: should we tail reeves? maybe not nyx... 
nyx: now that ellara is here, i want to be clear, i don't murder ppl for fun.
(still a few hours before it's late)
berridin reaches out 
nyx she probably dosen't want to hear my voice, just give it a shot
berridin 21 persusaion
ellara: yes. (curtly)
berridin: i just want to apologize, when i wake up i say thingsn that can be taken out of turn.
ellara: *sigh* i appreciate you reaching out to me, i accept your apology.
berridin: is there anything else you remember
ellara: i can' think of anything
berridin: we're trying to decide our next steps, part of it is to see what's happening with the warforged, to stop the attacks on the shadowed, like the mines. maybe we should tail donnathan.
ellara: oh yes, i did learn he's a viscount and he was going to visit the grand duke for a few days.
berridin: how do you want to split? we have two separate tasks. investigating the reeves family and monitoring the dawn. unfortunately i think nyx is still the best to tail people.
ellara: are you talking about tailing director reeves into the grand duke's palace??
nyx doing cut off motions
nyix: we don't want what happened to meri to continue. we need information.
ellara: yes i know because tailing someone into the grand palace is not the same as tailing them into a dark alley and killing them.
ellara: proctor eduouard said director reeves would be at the palace a few days, it may be late to tail him.
nyx insight test: 12. he heard some rumors about him. he does spend time in the ducal palace when he's in the city.
nyx mentions that. "that may be where we need to go to get more information"
nyx: thanks ellara, what are you going to do. what are your plans.
ellara: i will have to pray on it tonight, but i am concerned the ducal palace may be harder to sneak into than the light house.
nyx: just call tomorrow and let us know what you plan, hopefully we know what we'll do. let's not lose sight of what we're trying to achieve, we saw what happened to meri. it was meri now, it could be other shadowed later, we want to stop that.
ellara: have a blessed evening

ellara religion 18: she prays for guidance. comofrt in itself. thinking her thoughts. calmness comes, maybe not an answer. enough to be able to go bed. in her sleep. hear voices. in agony calling out, you can't hear what. they call out for help? all you see is an image of a little light crystal lamp on a desk. it's screaming at you. and wake up. it's the lamp she saw in the proctor's office.
---

they go to bed at nyx's as well. 
berridin playnig with dagegrs counter sleight of hand as nyx grabs dagger in the air before it hits ceiling.
nyx: please don't the molding are expensive. 
berridin covers a little etching he's doing on the wall but nyx notices. 
---

next day.
ellara insight 16: light crystal lamp. light crystal are formed by the remains of the shadowed. perhaps she felt the pain. 

ellara does her morning prayers and goes to his office. she tries opening door. it opens. she goes in and tries to take out the light crystal.
sleight of hand 8: reach a point where you could take out but it would cause damage. guidance +3. tries to leave the lamp in the samp position and and tries to find protor eduoard.
"oh ellara"
ellara; i had vision about about your lamp, was wondering if i could take it for a 
proctor: tell me more about your vision
she tells him about the screaming
proctor: in my years of experience, sometimes there are messages from eulogia, sometimes they tell us about our stresses and anxieties. you're welcome to borrow it. but this is the wrong path to examine it. maybe your dream is that frustration.
ellara: perhaps that is a metaphor but it would help me sleep better knowing i have that symbol of the light.
proctor: just please return it shortly, it's better at illuminating my office at night.
ellara: yes i will try to.
 she goes to her room
 investigation 16 - it's a light crystal. lamp.
she figures out the mechanism takes out the crystal itself. 
arcana 16 - it's a light crystal. same as any other.
perhaps the vision was not about this light crystal but about the pain they all represent

nyx household
nyx: what do you want do?

berridin flipping two knives
ysidor: we went over this, only flip one knife at atime
berridin: i'm going through something!
nyx: where do we hit first for recon.
ysidor: the lighthouse, maybe break some things.
nyx: berrriiddin.
nyx: before go back to the light house let's recap what went well and what didn't. we have an idea about the layout. what do we know and what's the best way to get in. we have to be careful with this. as a guard there was very little leeway. even in a disguise it depends on what the disguise is. 
berridin: we have to be able to adapt moment to moment. we just need to be more human. we stand out too much. we need standard disguises. 
nyx: ok, we'll do that and go to the light house and figure out what we see there.
disguises:

ysidor: moose
nyx: has hair, aragon's locks style. looks like aragorn. cover name - Noctis
berridin: 6 foot tall, ebony skinned, gruff soldier, scar across his cheek, short beard. thick Kal'din Veilspire

they approach the lighthouse.
nyx to berridin/kal'din: you know you can never use this persona again right? this is why i don't spend too long on it.

noctis to kal: we have these stones (the rune passes) but it'll trigger the system. and she's been missing... the guard might be in already as well. 

ysidor throws a rock at the warforged. there's an echoy sound. with another rock with angrier emotions. unarmed attack roll: 22. hits. it goes from 5 feet and rumbles. lights turn on. now it stands to 8 feet tall. it looks towards him. a guard runs out "what in the shadowed monarch is going on here"

moose points at the warforged: he started it
deception dirty 20
guard incredulous
moose: these machines... clearly defective.
guard goes to machine and sighs and goes back in, it powers down.

berridin: let's try again and nyx you sneak in during. 
moose stands between the two warforged.
he casts word of radiance, they save, no damage
initiative rolls

bullet time (combat)
- guard dashes out, he arrives right besides ysidor.
- berridin's turn, looks scared of the war forged, eyes locked on moose, unarmed push acting as if he has attacked his friend. strength check, it does not move but switches eyes to him. performance check bonus action: nat 1. guard capt'n suspects him
- other guard dashes out.
- nyx: tries to sneak in, stealth: 16. can sneak past but with an action to disengage. into the middle of the lobby. but towards the side.
- construct: 14 to attack. 13 points of damage on berridin.
- construct: attacks ysidor. 18 meets. 4 damage.
- ysidor: grabs berridin and bolts, no disengage so attacks of opp. 10 does not hit. 13 no hit. 16 no hit. 8 no hit. 35 feet away. lays on hand and fully heals berridin for 13.
- guard: chase + attack 12 no hit. nat 20. 17 damage -> stone's resistance -> 13 damage instead.
- berridin slung over a shoulder: minor illusion to create a wall. bardic inspiration on ysidor.
- guard is confused by the wall
- nyx: uses his pass at the gate. alarms go off. he tries to play it off - deception with disadvantage: 5. no one buys it.
- warforged: it looks at the wall. goes up to ysidor.
- warforged: other one turns, goes inside it is coming towards nyx.  7 doesn't hit. 12 doesn't hit.
- ysidor: disegage + run. shield of faith -> +2 AC.
- guard captn: runs and catches up. 11 doesn't hit. 1 doesn't hit.
- berridin: creates a minor illusion of nyx next to him. bardic inspiration on nyx. 
- guard: still confused by wall
- nyx: 18 to hit, 5 points of damage. runs out, dashes in a different direction.
- warforged a: attacks double illusion, then runs to door.
- warforged b: runs to catch up to ysidor. attacks. nat 20. berridin, silvery barbs. now 12. doesn't hit.
- ysidor: dashes away.
- 4 guards/warforged show up at the light house door.
- captain: dashes but can't reach ysidor
- berridin: minor illusion sound saying "captain another intrusion into the building", mirror image on ysidor.
- guard: figures out the wall (finally) heads to nyx.
- nyx: dash + trying to hide, stealth - 10. bardic inspiration 1d6 so 10 + 2, 12.
- warforged: realizes illusion follows
- warforged: follows captain, throws javelin 20. 19 damage. mirror image takes the hit but fails to prevent it 11 points of damage. 12 another 24 to hit. mirror image takes it and prevents it.
- ysidor: dash. he parkours up onto a roof and dashes there. out of combat.
- nyx: 30 feet away a ton of trouble, lots of warforged and guards. he notices ysidor get away.  blessing of the raven queen to teleport to the roof. then dashes and tries to hide. 19 stealth. out of combat.
----
combat over.
----

nyx sending stone (not ellara): hey, i'm good. are you guys good.
berridin: we're freaking out are you ok. 
nyx: i'll find you. insight 23 (you don't want to go to a big landmark, probably an east bastion place that could be used to meet up at, want to avoid an obvious place). meet me at Badwater Well in one day's time. 
---

ellara: sorry for not reaching out earlier, i think we do need to do something about the light crystal and the evils they bring... should i  go to ny--

nyx: NO, now is not a good time, give us 2 days, we'll call you. maybe don't go near the lighthouse.

ellara: did something happen?

nyx: everything is fine. (in a serious voice) have your sending stone on you.

ellara to berridin: master berridin is everything ok, nyx sounds very stressed. 

berridin: ellara, i've been thinking alot about this whole job thing. how did you get into this whole acolyte thing. what drives you.

ellara: fantastic, though i do not know if you want to follow my ptah because i was raised in the priory not knownig my parents.

berridin: i find myself in unsavoury situations

ellara: that would lovely, the light is there for those that seek it

berridin: we've just been discussing plan of action so we'll figure. 

ellara: o-ok, but i can't shake the feeling something is wrong, master nyx forget to speak in his condescending voice.

berridin: we made a bet.

ellara: a bet?

berridin: ysidor and nyx were arguing about something mundane. definitely not doing things without you.

ellara 21 insight vs 18 deception.

ellara: if i may, if you do wish to find the light, then the first step is to be honest. i will speak to you tomorrow.
