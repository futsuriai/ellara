berridin/ysidor  

in the eastern side there's a well that ran dry, the badwater well, not too far from the original congregation ppl met ellara at. 

nyx arrives roughly at the same time as ellara and sees ellara arrive.

nyx: do you think you were followed?
ellara: why would i be followed?
nyx: perecption check 7. everything looks fine.

--

ysidor/berridin:
halfinig children: berridin berridin look what we got
- not quite rotten but end of life fruits/veggies
berridin: thank you little ones, this is very nice i'll... eat it at a later time
- they leave walking over ysidor.
ysidor wakes.
halfinig enclave probably used the well until maybe 5 yeras ago.
berridin tosses him the ovrripe fruit.
ysidor: oh... is this the quality they get in the city..? (he eats it disparagingly) 
they make their way there.
ellara/nyx in a silent moment.

--- 

berridin: hey team !
nyx: how's it going, were you followed?
b: i don't know, maybe
nyx: perception 21, no traces of following.
ellara: why do you keep asking if we were followed.
nyx: things didn't go as well as we hoped
ellara: but master nyx, last we spoke you said nothing had happened.
nyx: <broad broadstrokes recounts what happened>, didn't want to freak you out.
ellara: <pats his head with a smile> see, doesn't it feel better to be honest.
nyx: i-i'm trying. 
nyx: ok, so, recap. what should we be doing next.
berridin: we still have the open question about donathan reeves. though we ware much more wary about infiltrating things... especially the ducal palace.
ellara: master nyx, have you ever been invited to the ducal palace?
nyx: history check nat 20. <thinking of it, the duke would never hire me directly but probably a past contract where some of the details... one of your most... the money the resources were given, you need to do x, y, z to these individuals. everything was well planned, didn't need to do much planning as it was all set up. it wasn't through a usual contact. it was probably form him but not directly.> "no, i suspect i had contracts from but through proxies, he would never invite me directly into the palace."
ellara: that's unfortunate.
ysidor: what about donathan's home? how tall is this donathan guy?
ellara: likeee 5'9?
ysidor: we can take him, grab him and take care of him in an alley.
ellara: what do you mean take care of him in an alley.
ysidor: i'm just giving ideas.
berridin: we don't we just observe the closest entrance to the ducal palace. would be interesting to see if we see the automatons besides just at the light house. if they're in a security position that could indicate a tie with the duke.
ellara: but what will tailing donnathan help with. 
nyx: it feels like we hae been reacting and i'm worried it'll get us killed. we have to be better at planning and doing osmetihng we can actually achieve.
ellara: my concern is you seem to be trying to interact with the aristocracy while not having any ins or connections.
nyx: if we go with berridi'ns suggestion, if we go and observe the palace at least it's somethin.g i suggest against trying to infiltrate it. but at least we will find something else. 
<gm note: reminders, donnathan is not from here. he has property somewhere. he does spend an inoordinate amount of time at the ducal palace, head of relations, responsible for negotiations between eulogia and aristocracy. people DO move in/out of ducal palace. lowest menial jobs would be lower class. probably does employ a non-insignificant amount of ppl> 
ysidor suggests some people find donnathan's house and look around while others try to sneak in as workers into the palace. 
nyx: i can work with that.
berridin: surprisingly eloquent explanaotino.
ysidor: what did i say.
ellara 4 history, berridin 3, nyx 2. ysidor survival 2. nature 7.
nyx you would known, as a property owner, that there's a registry with the city. you registered on the east side because administratively they're divided, you assume there's one on the west as well. Nyx tells the group. 
ellara + berridin -> ducal palace
shadowed gang -> administration.
berridin deception: 9 - for disguising ysidor. very pallid skin. looks 6'5. creepy pasty guy. Elk (since moose's disguise was blown)
berridin disguise self cast - as eulogian acolyte/priest, human. 
ellara: berridin 18 deceptoin to make her over as a different looking person but still eulogian. 

they cross over the ravine to divide the city, the main road feeds up towards the palace. you notice the light crystal lamps, would be illuminated at night, modest homes as they climb the hill to the palace the houses get less dense, richer. still some businesses but not stacked on each other, more distinct with their own properties. closer you get, walled in, private gardens. no security until the entrance to the palace grounds.

who is going in? we see people going in in carriages full of things, leaving empty, probably deliveries. some individuals walk in, guards on either side. also deactivated warforges on either side.

ellara religion 14: eulogians divided on warforged, initially they rejected light crystals, eduard is part of helping eulogia accept them. but still some whispering of did you hear about these machines that walk as people. this is an affront to the eternal light. proctor eduard says the eternal light gives us these gifts and the light shines through them. how could they be bad if the light shines through them.

while there's a lot of private properties around here. 
ellara perception 15, berridin nat 20. ellara notices there are more people leaving and see some of the names maybe i've heard (on the plates with family names etc, important) and shouldn't there be a locus of movement... berridin off the road notices an inn but unlike an inn you've ever seen, fanciest tavern ever. not nobility enter/leave but people in guards uniforms, well dressed uniforms. well to do women. they hold themselves in a way that tells you that the people that go here are not nobility with houses, more a meeting place or people visiting with no connection to the city but want to be near to where the connections are. they have the means to be near where those are. The Golden Dove. 

berridin pokes ellara to say we should explore that. ellara is not super comfortable with this but goes along.

"you have a reservation or a walk in"
b: "this is a walk-in"
"just two or more?"
b: just two
"follow me, we don't get too many eulogians in here. i'm new i'm a little nervous. we have meads/wins/some imported drink kind of like tea but very stimulating, popular among the nobility" 
b: let's try that.
"two servings of java"

nyx + elk. 
they want to go find the housing registry. 
nyx decides to go back to his place, carefully. 
nyx: let's look at my maps, figure out what gov't building we need to access to get this info.
stealth: nat 20(27) for nyx, 3 for ysidor.
nyx: elk, if i'm walking with you.. we're fucked, if you walk ahead you attract all the attention and i can sneak in. just be normal. 
elk: sounds good. 
both notice they give ysidor space, they think he's sick. 
ysidor insight 9. he doesn't notice they think that, he thinks they are polite. 
they reach his place. nyx perceptoin 17. sees no one.
he finds his maps. finds the location he needs to go to. they head over. crossing the main bridge. find themselves by the plain builidng. has 2 doors, one open, see ppl going in/out. civic hall of record. death/marriages/property records would be here. 
nyx pulls elk to the side, "i think it's best if i go in, i don't think they'll let soeone who looks sick in. i'll contact you with the sending stone if there's trouble"
elk: i don't have one.
nyx: oh. well, you'll find out what to do.
nyx goes in a bit of a line, 10mins. 
"good day sir, how may i help you"
nyx: "i have a housing record i'm looking for, where are they"
"some questions: whose and for what purposes"
nyx: "donnathan reeves"
"mr reeves, what is your relationship to him? they are public records but need to understand for our records"
nyx: "i'm one of his property managers, looking for more info as i just started he sent me here."
"your name sir?"
n: "alexander"
"let's seee reeves... give me a moment, i'll look in the appropriate section."some time goes by.
she returns.
"hm. donnathan reeves records, i wasn't able to find exactly this, there was a viscount de sommeil" 
nyx: i'll take it,
"you can't you can read them here though"
n: appreciate the help.

the doc says "reeves, donnathon viscount of sommeil" details on doors/windows/storiesl/etc. the record of landholding. nyx looks for something to write with and small pieces of paper. he grabs some and writes down the info/address. it's 3 stories, 2 cellars, large estate. on record it has multiple doors, balconies, etc. nyx writes it down. returns it. and then he goes back and hands it to back to the attendad.

n: thank you so much, also do you have the blueprint?
"there is a line? but also blueprints require their signature, they are not publically available"

elk standing outside. well dressed old lady: "sir sir are you alright, should you be at a medics"
elk: nah i'm fine
lady: are you sure, you don't look fine
elk looks at his skin: actually i usually look more grey than this.
lady: i'm concerned for you, are you being abused...
elk: abused by who?
lady: i don't know but this is very disconcerting
e: i did lose a lot of blood the other day but that's normal
lady: that is NOt normal, did you go to a medics.
e: you could call it a medic. just taking in the fresh air...
lady: come with me - she directs him
e: i probably should wait in case... the building falls.
lady puts her hand to his head to feel his temp: (goliatsh are cold) you're absolutely freezing, i cannot let you out here any longer
e: o-ok.
she takes him down the street, in 10 mins she opens a gate.
lady: jarvis jarvis, get some hot tea, call doctor ravolus. i found a sickly young man, very concerned.
jarvis: right away ma'am.
jarvis: here's some hot tea, and madam, i'll go fetch the docotr.
l: post haste post haste, now drink drink, have some tea it'll help.
l: is the tea too hot?
elk shots takes it like a shot from the fancy porcelain: yeah it's fin
l: why were you out? fresh air?
e: i've always been told it's good to spend hours outside to kee pthins lively
l: jarvis should be back soon with the doctor, are you new to the city you don't look familiar.
e: yes i came in from the.... south a feew weeks ago.
l: merchants son?
e: yyyep.
l; what kind of wares.
e: the usual. the wearable ones.
l; clothing?
e: yes, son of a clothes menchant.
l; to be honest i wouldn't have though so looknig at you.
e: he's not a good merchant.
l: that's not a good thing to say about your parents.
e: he makes due but i'm not familiar with the city. i came to retriev some items.
l: oh so with no servants... i guess he isn't doing that well.
jarvis comes over with the doctor.
the doctor motions to touch him.
ysidor insight 14. he realizes a closer examinaton will reveal his disguise.
he pushes the doctors hand away.
doctor: i'm trying to figure out your ailment.
e: i have a fear of other ppl touching me.
doctor: interesting. but you are awfully pale... and madam jacinta just said you did let her touch her.
e: um, i have a fear of men touching me.
d: have you had other symptoms besides a cold body temp.
e: i think i'm alright, mada jacinta has just been overly caring. i should get back to my wears and wearables.

berridin/ellara. 

java is served. 
berridin looks around (perception 17) he sees a lot of different ppl talking quietly. lot of different ppl, some finery, some guards at lunch, some socializing, some doing business. you do hear a rumor about a ball. "oh, the grand duke might be throwing a ball soon, i wonder if i'll get invited this time." the sense he gets is they want the attention of the duke or someone that would attend if they don't have those connections to find an in. 

berridin wants to try something with the waiter. 
"yes, brother"
b: come here whippersnapper, come a little closer
waiter: ah my dear. you know if we carved our holy statues in your image we might fill our our pews.
ellara: brother... your jokes are too much.
b: he likes it.
b: my dear, tell me a bit about this ball that people are talking about.
w: it started this morning, the gossip. looks like the grand duke oliander will be having a ball in the near future. his good friend is back and probably convinced him.
b: which good friend.
w: i'm not to sure, ther've been... they've sort of implied something about a friend... much like your subtelty to me.
b: interesting... we're looking for a fellow named donnathan reeves. or lord sommeil.
w: oh oh i think that was the name of the friend. i haven't seen him around but they were talking about how the viscount returned. 
b: give me a quick run down of who's in the room. just try.
w: sir this is awfully strange, i need to go to other tables. this is awfully forward.
b: has anyone ever told you your pretty face is wasted in this tavern why don't you work for us 
w: no... i attend my weekly service and this is enough for me, no offense, good luck to you.


ellara:  master berridn what was that.
b: i was just trying a different angle.
ellara: you're representing eulogia.
b: i think this represents eulogia. you live in bubble.
ellara: you. think. what you just did. represents eulogia.
b: i have seen some horny old men that are eulogia.
ellara: have you i do not believe you.
b: ellara, you're young in eulogia have you not met anyone who exhibits.
ellara: i may be young but lived my whole in eulogia and have never experienced something like that
ellara: perhaps you would be willing to come to a session at the seminary to see what it's
berridin: so we should get a way into the ball.
ellara yes but how do we get everyone in.
---

nyx goes out, where is elk?
he asks someone near where elk was and asks someone
n: have you seen a sickly man around here?
yes yes, lady dragged him over to her property, she's had an open heart since her wife died.
n: where?
past 3 streets that way and go left.
n: ok ok.
---

doctor to elk: when did your symptoms start, the paleness.
e: this morning.
doctor: oh so rapid onset. did you eat something strange
e: oh yes, an overripe apple.
doctor: oh yes, and your bowel movements
e: haven't had any.
doctor: constimpation... 
---

nyx knocks on the door. 
n: sorry a family member, very pallid, was suposed to wait outside. someone mentioned the owner of this house.
"oh oh, are you the merchant father of the clothes"
n: oh yes, yes.

n: oh oh my goodness, doctor. 
doctor: who are you
n: i'm his father, i heard the whole situation.
lady: oh you're the bad clothes merchant.
n: oh what did he say... what's the situation here.
lady: oh your son needs medical attention, his pallor, his temp, eatin ga rotten apple, are you abusing him?
n; oh no no, he's always had that pallor. in fact he probably at many breakfasts, he keeps eating random things, i don't know what he's thinking.
e: my papa sometimes abuses me.
doctor: lady jocinta, this seems like a family manner.
doctor: he seemsto have some delusions, he said he was keeping a building from falling.
n: we'll add that to the list. i keep telling him he can't do some things but it takes a while for him to... look he's not... i do everything i can but he's not the brightest...
doctor: oh oh yes. very brave of you to bring him out in public, make sure the help is with you next time.
n: the one time i thought it would do him so good to have some indepedence. mind you i was there less than an hour. now he's in a fantastic woman's home and causing all these probblems, appreciate your care and concern. hope you have a fantastic day.
Jocinta: well you can stay for lunch (after doc leavse)
n: we've imposed too mu--
elk: she's offering us lunch it would be rude to refuse (grabbing his arm)
n: if we don't i'll never hear the end of it, please don't go out of your way.
lady: jarvis bring the lamb out. oh i didn't get your names.
n: i'm alexandery.
lady: i'm jocinta, and your son's name.
elk: elk!
lady: oh elk that's a very unique name.
n: no, his name is elkorian, he likes to go by elk.
lady: ah yes that's quaint in a country kind of way. so if i understood correctly you're doing some trades
n: yes doing some errands, not sure what my son told you.
lady; that you're a terrible clothes tradesman
n: i've heard that before.
lady so what do you really do, alexander
n: yes i am a mechant i do dabble in completed pieces, very selected pieces, but the bulk has been around raw materials. 
j: i would love to see some samples, it would be great to see some. oh yes yes, i don't know if my neighbour is back he does like the newest fashions. jarvis send a note to the viscount that i may have a new clothes salesman for him.
n: oh thank you
j: yes yes i was friends with his mother, he's not in the city often but when he's heere he's usually at his friends the grand dukes. he should visit mor. they met at torchlight college and have been best friends since then. he's a second son but they have plenty of money for the heir and second son.
n; i'm always curious how they made money.
j: some kind of negotiator... he actually broughtthis <tiffany style lamp> he odes work with the lighthouse, he travels all the time and that's why he says he can't visit even though his mothera nd i were good friends.
n: this is exquisite.
j: yes yes, everyone has light crystals now but this is very artisanal. 
n: i do have to ask, i don't like to normally, but... a little more about the viscount, i just know nothing about him. but if he's staying that long at the palace, do you know why? i like to know why people do what they do.
j: you're not frome here are you... they're best friends since college but it's an open secret they are lovers since then. the grand duke has his wife and children, the viscount caught his eye since long ago and even influenced that marriage allegedly.
n: wow... call me out of the loop.
j: well it's not that out of the scandal, not everyone can find a match like i did with my valinda. 
n: that's fantastic. yes super important.
j: where are you staying, to see if i can get a message to the viscount to look at your ware.s
n: oh, hm, well i'm quite busy the next few weeks. let me think of where the best place to send a message. <history 11 - first name that comes to mind, the golden dove> i'm staying at the golden dove.
j: oooh, yes quite quite quite, i'll leave a message there for alexander. i do hope that.. elk feels better. if i speak to the viscount i'll send him your way to show him your wares.
n: thank you so much, i will do my best to be sure that... elk here not get into trouble as much. but i appreciate great people like you.

ellara: what do you think of this drink master berridin, it's quite invigorating.
b: yes this is quite good. <he surrpetitiously points to add alcohol> 
NEW waiter: adds it.
ellara has had a bunch of them. 
ellara excuses herself from the table for a second and goes find the first waiter.

ellara: i do wish to apologize for my companion, i had no idea he would act like that.
waiter: yes some of our older patrons are like that.
ellara: this does not represent the light of eulogia.
waiter: i think he's groping someone again...
ellara: if you ever come to the seminary i'll try to make it up to you.
waiter: if he's there maybe not.
ellara: i will make sure he is not.
waiter: thank you.
ellara: like you said i'll go back and deal with him.
ellara: insight 22 to find eulogia aligned ppl. some ducal guards. on their chestplace there's a symbol of eulogia.
ellara: master berridin do you think you'd be able to behave.

she'll walk over to the guards.
guard raises her eye to her.
ellara: may the eternal light bless your food
guard: <proper ellarian response>
ellara: it's so nice when lay people honor eulogia as much you do.
guard: my name is diane. <some more proper rite-like response>
ellara: i was wondering if you knew if the ball would have eulogian representation, so worried that it would devolve..
diane: it does tend to have a eulogian, proctor eduard does stand out as a commo
(fill in this chat - very proper eulogian responses).
ellara: are you sure you didn't go to seminary.
diane: you flatter me.
(exact conversation not recorded) but something about ppl following the light, something about her being better with swords than books. counterpoint to say her words are as sharp as her sword probably. about her companion being up to no good. she angrily walks back, gets the bill on the way and slaps it on his table and tell him to tip.
it was 2 gold.

---

nyx: through sending stones, let's meet at my place.
---
nyx: you wanted the lamb didn't you.
elk: well it was good lamb. no one died.
nyx: how long will that happen.
ellara/berridin enter.
nyx to ellara: you looked like you also yelled at someone. what did 
ellara: the light tell us not to speak ill of people.
berridin: she's so tightly woven and up in my case. 
ellara: you will not be going as a eulogian. 

berridin: how did you do.
nyx: he got pulled in by a rich lady, and then he wanted to stay for lunch. but yes. we got information. 
ysidor: lady jacinta was very pleasant. 
nyx: yes but the doctor was going to find out you were fine, it's a miracle i got there in time. 
berridin: netx time lets' go back to the original teams.
nyx: recounts the story.
nyx: i said i was staying at the golden dove, i need to book a room there.
ellara looks around at his decorations: i suppose you could afford it, maybe.
nyx: i told her i dabbled in fineries and clothing but mostly raw materials and she would introduce me to the viscount. 
nyx: not sure what i should do when i meet him. i don't know much about clothing.
berridin: maybe we just kill the other director.
ellara: i think you have said enough master berridin.
berridin to nyx: you don't actually have to become a textile merchant.
nyx: insight 13. should be fine not to book the room immediately. 
nyx decides to go now to book the room. he tells the room.\
nyx: i'll be back soon, help yourselves to the food, berridin if you take anything i'll kill you.
ellara decides to leave for her dorms with nyx.
ellara 10 perception, nyx 7. don't notice anything.
