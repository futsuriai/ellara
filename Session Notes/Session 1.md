## Session 1: The Adventure Begins

**Date:** Year 651 AE (After Eulogia)
**Location:** Bastion City, Hieroterra Province, Hariolar Empire

**Opening Scene:**
The session opens in the year 651 AE (After Eulogia) in Bastion City, the capital of Hieroterra, an eastern province of the Hariolar Empire. Hieroterra, ruled by Duke Valerian Oleander, is considered a somewhat backwater region where the Eulogia's influence is less potent and there's a significant "shadowed" population. Bastion City is bisected by a canal into West and East. The West is opulent, featuring the ducal palace, a Eulogian edifice, and aristocratic residences. The East houses the Duskbreaker Lighthouse, a light crystal research center. New light crystal lamps, an early product of the lighthouse, illuminate the main streets of East Bastion. However, this side of the city is generally more modest and utilitarian, with less paved roads and simpler homes, especially further from the lighthouse. East Bastion also serves as a gateway to the province's more untamed areas.

**Early Interactions & Plans:**
Following an unrecorded exchange where Tsi'nyra expressed some form of disagreement or negative observation ("not really"), Nyx stated his belief that they must find more allies and that he would see what he could do to achieve this.

**Berridin & Ysidor in the Halfling Quarter:**
Berridin led Ysidor to the halfling residential area, where Ysidor's large stature was particularly noticeable. Berridin asked Ysidor to eat some of a loaf of bread, concerned it might not be enough once the young halflings arrived. Soon, small halfling children, about a foot and a half tall, appeared and began climbing on Ysidor. Berridin announced his and Ysidor's arrival. Amidst playful interactions, including a comment (possibly from or to someone named Trea) about not giving the children candy, Berridin assured them it was "all healthy food," alluding to a past "candy incident of 650." The children eagerly greeted "Uncle Berridin" and wanted to play. To create a diversion, Berridin gestured to Ysidor, asking if his people fart. After Ysidor confirmed, Berridin cast a minor illusion of a fart cloud, enabling them to slip away from the children. He then went to check on a neighbor, mindful of Ysidor's heavy presence.

**Ellara's Inquiries:**
Ellara visited the Denmother to inquire about a goliath. The Denmother surmised the goliath was likely arrested and could be found in the eastern prisons. Ellara requested assistance in gathering information, and the Denmother agreed to try. The Denmother remarked that it was good of Ellara to be in the city, having come from "outside of the gaze of the light." Ellara affirmed her belief that her priory is "within the light." Afterwards, Ellara returned home and wrote a letter to a friend from her hometown.

**Nyx & Tsi'nyra â€“ Keeping Secrets:**
Nyx instructed Tsi'nyra not to reveal where he lives and to keep their information secret. Tsi'nyra agreed, saying, "Mum's the word." Tsi'nyra, along with her leopard companion who was also eating, showed fascination with the local food and unfamiliar amenities like plumbing, fidgeting with them.

**Nyx Gathers Information:**
Nyx decided to go to a watering hole in a shadier area of the city, where people might talk more freely, to seek information. He asked the bartender if there was any news about his missing folk, but the bartender initially had no information. Nyx requested they keep an ear out. The bartender mentioned a "young guard captain" who, it was said, "maybe luck hasn't been with him."

Later, Nyx was dealt into a card game and received an "abysmal hand," prompting him to remark, "Luck is not on my side tonight."

Eventually, someone at the bar mentioned that their friends had also reported people missing. A nearby guard initially dismissed these concerns as common. However, when it was emphasized that "this is different," the guard recalled a goliath who had gone missing about two months prior, a case similar to what Nyx was investigating ("yeah, that sort of thing"). The guard, who wasn't present at the incident itself, relayed a dramatic account: the goliath had reportedly "taken out 20" assailants. Those who saw the aftermath described the attackers as "beat up pretty bad." The goliath was initially held in an eastern prison but was then, described as "so weird," moved to one of the western prisons. At this point in his story, the guard became physically ill and abruptly stopped talking.
