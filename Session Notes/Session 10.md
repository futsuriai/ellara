# Session 10 — *The Brothers Whitaker*

**Locales:** The Golden Goose (Hotel; occasionally mis-called “Golden Dove”) · Nyx’s Townhouse · Lord Whitaker’s Estate · The Grand Duke’s Palace
**Time:** Two days leading up to the Ball → The Night of the Ball

---

## 1) The Invite & The Hotel

Ellara returned to her dorm to find a high-quality envelope waiting for her—her name written cleanly on the front. Inside was a formal letter from **Proctor Eduard**, referencing her recent interest in the **Duskbreaker Lighthouse** and her meeting with **Director Reeves**, and inviting her to attend the Grand Duke’s ball in two days to observe how **Eulogia** interacts with the nobility and to better understand the politics around the Lighthouse. 

She immediately messaged the group via sending stone. She also wrote a letter home to her friend about everything that’s been happening. 

Nyx went to the **Golden Goose** to book a room.

* **Logistics:** (**Intelligence 12**) He realized he needed a buffer of a few days around the ball. 
* **The Quote:** “**20 gold for 5 nights, sir.**” Nyx paused, staring at his very real **5 gold**. 
* **The Pivot:** He asked the nightly rate (“**5 gold per night**”) and tried to take **one night**. The clerk explained he could instead put down **a 5 gold deposit** toward the longer stay—*plus a deposit, of course.* 
* **The Collateral:** Nyx produced his sickle. The clerk stared.
  *“Oh so crude, why are you handing me a gardener’s tool?”*
  *“I travel light. This is very sentimental.”* 
* **The Room:** “It’s the floor above.” Elegant, but spartan. 

He sent the group the truth, unvarnished: *“I’ll be honest, I got a room but I don’t have enough money at the moment.”*

## 2) The Dreamer Wakes — Enter Witty

Somewhere on the West Side, a new figure woke from a dream—because **Lord Whitaker (“Witty”)** doesn’t do nightmares. He dreams of puppies, flowers, and being one with the animals and birds. 

He rose in a silken gown, reached for the cup of tea that should have been waiting, and found nothing. His manservant hadn’t been around lately—so Witty attempted to make his own tea, burned himself, and wandered, offended by the world’s refusal to run correctly. 

Then: the mail.

A little envelope. A smile. *“Ohh, mail… how quaint.”* He opened it with a letter-opener like it was a ritual. 

Inside: a lavish invitation—**a Grand Soiree at the Duke’s Palace in two days**—calligraphy, seal, and all. Witty practically spun in place.

**Witty:** *“I finally get a chance to wear my nicest suit… and maybe this is when I finally get to rub elbows with people at the lighthouse! And get to meet more nobility in Bastion City!”* 

But he couldn’t press his own laundry (an unthinkable indignity), and his manservant was a halfling—so naturally Witty decided the solution was to head toward the **Halfling Enclave** to find him. On the way, he stopped to admire the Lighthouse, openly awestruck. It wasn’t just a building to him. It was a destination.

## 3) The Heist at Nyx’s Townhouse

Berridin woke from the usual: iron, steel, fire, smoke in his lungs—faces he could never quite see. He woke Ysidor with one simple conclusion:

**Berridin:** “I think we need to hook up with Nyx at his room.”
They were still at **Nyx’s townhouse**—not the hotel. 

* **The Loot:** (**Perception 19**) Berridin spotted a **crystal serpent**—golden inlay, gold and silver filigree, gem eyes. He considered swiping it, then decided (briefly) that he was a hero now. 
* **The Call:** He contacted Nyx (at the hotel) about pawning something for money. Nyx fixated immediately.
  **Nyx:** *“The snake? That’s perfect—yeah yeah yeah—I love that thing, but do what you gotta do.”*
  Then—more soberly—Nyx steered him toward a **small cache** instead. 
* **The Lock:** (**Sleight of Hand 14**, with help/advantage) Berridin cracked the cache. 
* **The Find:** **82 gold**. (Nyx’s definition of “small” remained an active threat.) 
* **The Taking:** Berridin took **50 gold** anyway. 
* **The Threat:** Nyx’s response arrived like a blade slid under a rib.
  *“I know exactly how much is in that smallest of my caches. Grab 10 gold, it’s yours. Bring the rest. I will kill you if you steal more. And my trust.”* 

Berridin patted the serpent on the way out.

## 4) The Street Con — “All Purple”

Berridin set to work.

* (**Deception 16**) He dressed Ysidor up as a nobleman.
* He made himself an average-sized human—still using the name **Calvin Valespire**, since he hadn’t spoken it aloud when the previous disguise was lost. 

On the street: a lost-looking aristocrat whose clothes could be crisper.

* **Witty’s Perception (11):** insufficient, as a kid lifted a small trinket from his pocket and vanished.
* **Berridin noticed.** Witty didn’t. 

Berridin approached with the easy confidence of a man who was about to become a problem.

**Berridin:** “You look a little lost there, fella.”
**Witty:** “I am. I seem to have gotten turned around.” 

Witty explained he was looking for his manservant, **Jarvis**—a halfling from the Whitaker estate in **Vassilia**—gone missing a few days ago. 

Berridin performed the appropriate fake competence:

* (**History 5**) “Haven’t heard of him… doesn’t even sound like a halfling name.”
* Witty, unfazed: “The halflings in my estate tend to take the names of normal people.” 

Then the tailor act landed fully.

**Witty:** “Do you work with purple? I’m thinking… all purple.” 
Berridin cast **Prestidigitation**, smoothing every wrinkle from Witty’s clothes and adding a clean purple touch at the neck.

**Berridin:** “I think purple would work.” 

He invited Witty back to his “spot”—then quickly reframed it as a rendezvous with “colleagues” at a ritzy hotel. Witty, delighted:

**Witty:** “Oh I do love hotel parties… can make messes I couldn’t at home.”

## 5) The Illusion Suit

Back at Nyx’s place (the hotel-room orbit of it all), Berridin took measurements like a man conducting sacred geometry.

**Berridin:** “Tell me, Lord Witty—what’s your favorite outfit?”
**Witty:** “Tall top hat… suede or velvet. A long sweeping coat. A vest—three-piece—with a bowtie. A small cane. And glass vials—different colors.” 

*In the distance: a boom.*

**Berridin:** “Did you want purple?”
**Witty:** “Everything.” 

Berridin used a disguise kit and illusion work to produce the masterpiece: a purple tuxedo with top hat, vest, bowtie, and a comically small cane.

* **Reality Check:** (**Wisdom Save 2**) Witty did not notice it was an illusion in the slightest. 
* **The Confession:** Berridin finally admitted it was illusion magic—demonstrating a hand passing through the fabric and warning that touch would break the effect. 
* **The Question:** “Is that like… Shadowed?”
  **Berridin:** “Sometimes, if you’re pushing the realms of what is possible… this is my own science.” 
* **The Explosions:** Another boom. Witty checked his vials, noticed some were missing, and shrugged like the universe was a light suggestion. 
* **Payment:** Berridin asked **10 gold**. Witty paid **12** without hesitation. 

Berridin sent Nyx a message: they were coming—with gold.

## 6) The Gang Assembles — Success Gas

Nyx (posing as “Alexander”) spotted the trio in the lobby immediately. (**Perception 19**) The tell-tale gold-in-hair shimmered like a confession.

**Berridin:** “Alexander, it’s Kal’din—your good buddy.”
Nyx pointed at the gold in Berridin’s hair: *That buddy?* 

Nyx glanced at Ysidor’s disguise and guessed wildly: “E-elk?”
**Witty:** “I prefer venison.” 

Nyx tested the “outfit,” expecting a mundane disguise—his hand passed through Witty’s sleeve. He smirked. Said nothing. 

Upstairs, staff knocked.

**Staff:** “Mr. Alexander.”
Nyx hissed everyone into hiding and took the envelope without fully opening the door. 

Witty introduced himself properly—**Lord Whitaker the 6th**—with the confidence of a man who had never once met consequences.

He pitched his dream: a school, students, gases, glory—**the Institute of Philosophical Pneumatics (IFN)**—and above all, an interview with **Director Faberge**. 

Nyx and Berridin whispered in fragments (Nyx **Stealth 12**, Berridin **Stealth 19** vs Witty **Perception 15**). Witty caught the word *“trust”* and missed everything that mattered. 

Nyx accepted him anyway.

**Nyx:** “Welcome aboard, Lord Whitaker.” 

Witty, delighted, asked about Nyx’s name. Nyx explained: “Alexander” in public. “Nyx” for friends. Witty looked genuinely moved—then confessed the most dangerous thing he’d said all night:

**Witty:** *“Yes and giddy, for I have never had friends.”* 

### Ellara Arrives

Ellara knocked and entered like judgment wearing clean robes.

Nyx introduced the new “friend.”
**Witty:** “Call me Lord Witty.”
Nyx, dryly: “Berridin always has the gold thing. That’s how you know.” 

Witty asked if they were a “travelling troupe.” Nyx called it a mission. Witty called it the craziest hotel party he’d ever attended. 

### The Whitaker Lineage (as told by Witty)

Witty explained he was the **6th son** of Lord Whitaker of an inland province of **Vasilia**, in **County Cork**.

* Whitaker 1 & 2: Torchlight.
* Whitaker 3: “I’d rather not talk about him.”
* Whitaker 4: a traveler, exploring **Boaden**.
* Whitaker 5: joined the clergy. 

He claimed the nickname “Witty” came from sheer genius: *“In every situation I just think to myself what would a genius do… and I just do that.”* 

### Better Living Through Chemistry

Witty unveiled his invention: **Success Gas**—“intelligence in a bottle,” taken daily.

**Berridin (helpfully):** it’s a mixture of **snake venom** and the **anal glands of a sphinx**—gassified until inert—producing confidence and a high. 

Nyx assessed it. (**Nature 16**) Not poison. Just a narcotic good time.

Nyx pulled rank the only way Nyx knows how: by being terrifying.
**Nyx:** “Alright. We have the party. I have the envelope. I don’t want anyone taking anything… until after the party.” *(crossbow out)* 

Witty insisted: “No age limit.” Then, while Nyx physically held Berridin back from volunteering, Witty produced a blue-swirling inhaler and handed it to Ysidor. 

* **Ysidor:** took a big hit (**Con Save 5**, DC 13). For the next **4 hours**, he started seeing “the light” and suffered disadvantage on sight/vision checks. 
* **Berridin:** snuck a hit (**Sleight of Hand 10** vs Nyx **9**; **Con Save 12**). Same effect. 

**Witty:** “You want to see the eternal light.”
Nyx physically blocked the inhaler from reaching Ellara. 

Ellara refused—hard.

**Ellara:** *“Clarity of mind is how you find the light, not clouding your eyes.”* 

Ysidor pointed at nothing. Ellara warned: “The shadows love to deceive by seeming like light.” Berridin responded by casting a shower of sparks: *“Bro check this out.”* 

### Nyx’s Letter (and the Pivot)

Nyx showed Ellara the actual reason he’d booked the room: a neat, short note addressed to “Master Alexander,” mentioning **Lady Jacinta** (his “ever concerned neighbour”) and saying she couldn’t make the ball—but would like to see his wares afterward. Nyx exhaled: at least he wouldn’t have to pretend to be a tailor at the ball. 

Ellara, now grimly practical, admitted her worry: she didn’t want to be the only one there besides… *this* Lord Whitaker. Witty suggested she try smiling. 

Nyx asked the real question: could Witty get them in?

**Answer:** the invite was to the **household**. 

Witty proposed the obvious crime: impersonate Whitaker brothers—specifically the **4th**, who was “in the wilderness.” He even offered Nyx as a dance partner, because Witty’s brain was a pinball machine. 

Nyx asked about sisters. Witty said his father only allowed males in the household. 

Nyx asked what to do about Ysidor—while Ysidor was throwing Berridin up and down like a toy. Witty cast **Feather Fall** to slow the halfling’s descent and—helpfully—announced that “Caribou” looked quite like Whitaker the 4th. 

Ellara left to study, declaring the rest of them functionally useless.

Witty returned to preparing more gases and invited Berridin to use the manservant’s quarters—mentioning that when Jarvis vanished, **a large portion of Witty’s wardrobe vanished too**. Berridin took another hit later (**Con Save 16**) and resisted the worst of it. 

Nyx checked another stash with a desperate luck-prayer (needed 95+). He rolled **79**. He found only **30 gold** and realized he’d left too much money in the “small cache” Berridin had already robbed.

## 7) Court Prep — Ellara Studies (and Gets a Warning)

Ellara did the responsible thing: morning prayers, then straight to Proctor Eduard’s office.

**Eduard:** “Ellara, I assume you’re here about the ball.”
He told her she wouldn’t be expected to dress as nobility—just clean Eulogian garb. He reassured her that as his guest, she’d be forgiven mistakes, and encouraged her to treat it as an opportunity to learn. 

Ellara asked what she should study. Eduard suggested a book—check with the Denmother—and reminded her the whole point was observation. They’d go by carriage. No one else from the seminary was attending; they’d likely be among the most “common” people there. Ellara, remembering Arkos, quietly panicked. Eduard shrugged it off: nobles aren’t so different—just richer, and eager to show it. 

Ellara went to the Denmother, who produced a dusty old tome on court manners.

**Denmother:** “Stay away from them. They are hedonists.”
When Ellara protested that nobility *should* have the strongest connection, the Denmother replied:
**Denmother:** “The older the tree, the old roots wither.” 

Ellara locked in and studied.

## 8) The Ball Begins

### Ellara’s Arrival

Ellara met Eduard in full proctor regalia and rode with him to the palace. He briefed her on the guest of honor: **Lady Ophelia Xanteres Oliander**, Marchioness of Bastion City, the Grand Duke’s niece and heir—returned from **Torchlight College**. It was, in large part, a celebration of her return. 

The palace up close hit Ellara like a wave. Inside: art deco opulence—vaulted ceilings, sharp lines, harsh perfection, and **light crystals everywhere**. 

They were announced:

**“Proctor Eduard of the Eulogian Church—and Sister Ellara.”** 

Eduard led her to the host line: the tall, salt-and-pepper **Grand Duke of Hieroterra**; **Donnathan Reeves** in blues; and Ophelia in crimson with feathered detailing.

Eduard bowed deeply—addressing “your grace,” “your most honorable marchioness,” and “your honorable viscount”—and presented Sister Ellara. 

The Grand Duke greeted Ellara quietly, noting Eduard had spoken of her curiosity about the Lighthouse and Eulogian relations—alongside honoring his niece’s return. Ophelia greeted Ellara as a fellow Eulogian, wishing her to walk in the light; Ellara returned it. 

Ophelia mentioned she’d just returned and that things were hasty—Reeves wanted the celebration quickly. Then she let slip something about army delays at a mining town… and immediately tried to swallow the topic whole. Eduard steered it hard toward the “incident” involving the shadowed village and the mines; Ellara echoed the party line about teaching the Shadowed and bringing them closer to the light. Ophelia apologized and excused herself to greet other guests. 

### The Whitakers’ Arrival

Back at Witty’s estate, rooms were assigned:

* **Ysidor:** an estate room.
* **Berridin:** the manservant’s chambers.
  At some point Berridin’s disguise faded—he was visibly a halfling again—while Ysidor remained a looming seven feet of “yes, this is normal.” 

Witty mistook Berridin for Jarvis anyway.

**Witty:** “Oh Jarvis, you’re here.”
**Berridin:** “Witty, do we all look alike to you?” 

Witty tried to smooth it over with pure nonsense (maybe he got work done, maybe he mentioned not liking his nose). Berridin demanded they do this conversation over steaks, then refused to cook—until Witty mentioned “ethnic food,” at which point Berridin produced a technically perfect, violently spicy curry (**Sleight of Hand 20**) that made Witty cough through every bite. 

Berridin negotiated terms:

* Don’t call him “manservant.”
* What would his daily stipend be, hypothetically?
  Witty offered philosophy (“mutual dependency”) instead of numbers—so Berridin named a number and held out a hand. Witty gave him **20 gold** up front, while admitting family funds weren’t currently flowing. 

Witty mentioned his feet were sore and needed a massage. (This became relevant immediately.)

Nyx arrived.

**Nyx:** “Hello Lord Witty.” *(then, to Berridin)* “My money.” 

Berridin paid back, slowly and painfully: **50**, then **10**, then **10**, then **2**—until Nyx had the demanded **72 gold** in hand.

**Nyx:** *(leaning in)* “Never short change me again.” 

Witty—sockless, apparently—reached toward Berridin again like the massage was still on the table. 

### The Brother Swap (Final)

Witty laid out the brothers’ “brand colors”:

1. Red (Heir)
2. Blue (Torchlight)
3. Orange (the one who vanished after *an incident*)
4. Brown (Explorer)
5. Yellow (Eulogian)
6. Purple (Witty) 

Side note, per the table conversation: Eulogians wear **navy/white**. 

They settled on the plan that fit both the rumor and the logistics:

* **Berridin:** Whitaker **3** (Orange — the scandalous “exile,” returned)
* **Nyx:** Whitaker **4** (Brown — the traveler/explorer)
* **Ysidor:** Whitaker **5** (Yellow — the clergyman) 

Witty provided the one useful piece of lore he had: long ago, at a different ball, the **3rd** was dared into something involving a **viscount’s daughter**—and was never seen again after. 

### The Carriage & The Door

Witty insisted on the most opulent carriage possible—ordered late, arriving late. The driver named the price:

**Driver:** “Our services are **10 gold** for the evening.”
Witty waved it off: “My manservant will take care of it.”
The driver, deadpan: “Did you mean your eldest brother would pay?”
Witty: “Yes, yes, of course. The third.” 

Berridin paid the **10 gold** through his teeth.

At the palace entrance, staff confirmed the invite:

**“The Lords Whitaker… which ones are present?”**
**“Three through six.”** 

Then, the announcement—slightly mangled by ceremony:

**“The Lord(s) Whitaker Whitmas—3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th!”** 

Ellara heard it from within the party—late in the evening—and felt her stomach drop.

### The Host Line — The Orange Problem

They approached the hosts. Witty bowed deeply, formal as a blade, presenting his “older siblings” to the Grand Duke. 

**Donnathan Reeves** (immediately, dangerously):
*“Whitman… Whitakers… it’s been a while. That **Orange**… we thought you died after that incident.”* 

Berridin, muttering under his breath:
*“He didn’t catch me… I had to lay low for a while.”* 

Reeves smiled like someone remembering an old joke that was probably a crime.

**Reeves:** “I didn’t realize you would take that dare all the way.”
**Berridin:** “Sometimes you have to challenge yourself.” 

Reeves noted he’d heard Witty came, and seemed surprised the whole set was present—perhaps just to keep him company. Nyx patted “Orange” on the shoulder in perfect supportive-brother fashion. 

Then Reeves, turning back toward the Duke—“Oleandar darling”—started reminiscing about growing up with the older siblings, and the time the eldest and Reeves dared the third to… something he “shouldn’t say in polite company.” 

And just like that, they were dismissed into the party—cover intact, danger implied, and the night officially underway.
