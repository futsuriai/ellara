## 1) The Ball Begins — Mingling and Masquerades

The **Grand Duke’s Ball** was a swirl of art deco opulence, harsh geometric lines, and blinding light crystals. The party, dispersed under their various "Whitaker" guises, began their operations amidst the high collars and tailcoats of the elite.

*   **Ellara:** Escorted by **Proctor Eduard**, she was introduced to the nobility. She felt the weight of the court's scrutiny but leaned on Eduard’s advice to observe rather than participate.
*   **Witty (Whitaker 6):** Hit the dance floor with enthusiasm and a complete lack of skill (**Performance Nat 1**). He stepped on toes, bumped into guests, and remained blissfully unaware of his awkwardness, convinced he was the life of the party as people politely dodged him.
*   **Nyx (Whitaker 4):** Stood to the side, brooding in character as the "Nature Boy" explorer, radiating a "don't talk to me" aura while scanning the room.
*   **Ysidor (Whitaker 5):** The "Eulogian" brother. He immediately located the food service. He grabbed an entire plate of pigs-in-a-blanket ("Thank you, young sir," he told the baffled server) and began collecting glasses of various alcohols to hold simultaneously, failing to blend in (**Charisma 4**).

### The "Orange" Brother Moves
**Berridin (Whitaker 3)** scanned the room (**Perception 11, Insight 5**), adopting the persona of the scandalous, arrogant brother. He checked if anyone was interested in him (no one was), ran his hand through his hair like an 80s movie heartthrob, and hunted for gossip. He eventually spotted **Lady Ophelia** moving through the crowd alone. He wove towards her, dancing "subtly" through the crowd (**Performance Dirty 20**), effectively peacocking to catch her attention (**Persuasion 23**).

### The Hungry Eulogian
Ellara noticed the large, clumsy "Eulogian" brother devouring food and asked Proctor Eduard about him.
**Ellara:** "I do not recognize him... I wonder how he got here."
**Eduard:** "Apparently he is from a noble family... I was not aware of that. We should introduce ourselves."

They approached Ysidor, who was wiping grease on his robes.
**Eduard:** "Brother, I believe it's... Brother Whitaker, I take it? The Fifth?"
**Ysidor:** (Mouth full) "I do well sir, how do you?"
**Ellara:** "I find it so humbling a person from a noble life would choose this option with all the other options available."
**Ysidor:** (**Persuasion w/ disadvantage 15**) "Humbleness is the key to salvation, as they say."

Eduard played along politely but soon excused himself to speak to **Lord Reeves** and **His Grace**, suggesting Ellara and Ysidor escort one another.

Once alone, Ysidor leaned in for a "subtle" whisper that was barely quiet.
**Ysidor:** *"It's me! It's Ysidor! I was told to put this on."*
**Ellara:** (Jolting) "I am so glad this is you and not Berridin."
**Ysidor:** "Would you like some wine?"
**Ellara:** "...Why not."

## 2) Conversations and Confrontations

### Nyx and Donnathan
Nyx, watching from the sidelines (**Perception 7**), found **Donnathan Reeves** suddenly at his shoulder.
**Reeves:** "Whitaker 4, it's been a while. How did your brother convince you to come here? Last I heard you were up in **Boaden**."
**Nyx:** "I was busy, but he has a way of getting me to... join things I might normally not."
**Reeves:** "Younger brothers... I know I do it with mine all the time. Well, you've filled out a lot since the last time I saw you."
**Nyx:** "Well thank you. How have you been?"
**Reeves:** "Well, you know. Last time I saw you at a party, you left so abruptly it was so unfortunate. I was going to invite you to an afterparty. Are you just going to disappear again?"
**Nyx:** "Despite my upbringing, this kind of party has never been my thing, but my younger brother convinced me to stay."
**Reeves:** "Don't be a stranger."
Reeves slid a hand on Nyx's shoulder, lingering a moment too long, before walking away. Nyx remained outwardly calm but was internally rattled.

### Witty and Lady Jacintha
Witty, rebounding from a failed attempt to woo a young lady who practically fled from him, found **Lady Jacintha**—the "concerned neighbor" Nyx had invented a connection with earlier.
**Witty:** (Bowing, hat off) "Whitaker the 6th, how do you do."
**Jacintha:** "Lady Jacintha. I see you know Viscount Reeves... Are you part of Arthur's brood?"
**Witty:** "Oh yes, I'm his youngest son."

Jacintha (**Insight 18**) was taken aback by his boldness but amused; she saw him as a naive, wealthy plaything.
**Witty:** "I've been so well off I was able to hire a new servant for only 20 a month."
**Jacintha:** "My child, even a good servant is only worth a gold a month. You are being highway robbed."
**Witty:** "No, no, he's worth it. His **ethnic food** is great." (A callback to Berridin's spicy curry).

They pivoted to gossip.
**Jacintha's Gossip:**
*   **Ophelia** has returned from Torchlight College with no formal engagement.
*   There is buzz about the **Duke’s intent** with his niece; as he has no children, she is the heir, but his interest may be more than avuncular. "We don't know if he'll be as liberal with her as she is with him."
*   **Wealth:** Jacintha revealed she married into her wealth, or rather, her late husband married into *her* connections.

Witty, in a moment of flair, spun and snapped two champagne flutes from a passing tray (**Acrobatics 15**). Jacintha clapped, delighted: "Bravo."

## 3) The Dance — Berridin and Ophelia

Berridin approached **Ophelia**. He studied her (**Insight Nat 20**) and saw past the "kind, gentle heir" mask to the cold, calculating operator underneath. She was in her element.

**Ophelia:** "If I'm not mistaken, you're Whitaker the 3rd."
**Berridin:** "Yes, my lady. Whitaker Whitman the 3rd."
**Ophelia:** "Oh yes, you know how it is. It's so draining to meet everyone in these things."
**Berridin:** "My dear lady, if I could be so bold. I noticed you across the room and I have to say, you wear your role impeccably. I don't mean to say you come across as fake, I just appreciate your discipline."
**Ophelia:** (Mask dropping briefly) "I knew you were far more interesting than you let on. So you peacock for my attention? You're not the first little boy to try that."
**Berridin:** "I've learned in my travels... those who appear too eager I can handle, but the ones who hide their ambition through patience... that is truly terrifying. But I appreciate your demeanor."
**Ophelia:** "What ambitions? I have it all. I am the heiress to the Grand Duchess. Is that what you have been doing after walking away?"
**Berridin:** "I don't look for scandals, but connections."
**Ophelia:** "Don't presume to punch so high. The best you could do is see the inside of my chambers."
**Berridin:** "It's usually a good sign when the lady brings up her chambers first."
**Ophelia:** "I could also bring the guards. I assume you don't want to embarrass your brother."

She agreed to dance. As the song ended (**Performance 16**), Ellara swooped in to "save" Ophelia (**Stealth 17** to glare at Berridin on the way out).

**Ophelia:** "Oh, Sister Ellara... It's so refreshing. The teaching of the Light is universal... It is just how the stories are woven that differs."
**Ellara:** "That is so true. I mainly came over because I was wondering if that man had been bothering you."
**Ophelia:** "So kind. It often happens. Young noblemen often see a title and an opportunity. This is not the first time I have had 'tutors' of his ilk."
**Ellara:** "Of course, someone as beautiful as you..."
**Ophelia:** "No need for flattery... The Light does include all kinds of love; you didn't take vows of chastity, did you?"
**Ellara:** "No... back in the Highlands, if the devout followed that tradition, we would have died out long ago."
**Ophelia:** "Of course. Some try to use the Light to blind others—carrying a **false light** in their pocket like those crystals. Sometimes people mistake that for the Eternal Light."
**Ellara:** (Touched) "I've studied my whole life and you already seem so far beyond me in wisdom."
**Ophelia:** (Lifts Ellara's chin) "Do not worry... I see much of the Light reflected in you. A true friend is a hard thing to find in this world, especially among this **viper den**. Maybe I'll take you up on that offer one day."

## 4) Eavesdropping on Power

As the night wound down, Witty left with Lady Jacintha, giving Nyx two thumbs up. Berridin scouted for targets (**Perception 14**) and spotted the "Big Four" conferring privately: **The Grand Duke**, **Ophelia**, **Donnathan Reeves**, and **Proctor Eduard**.

He crept close (**Stealth 23**) to listen to the most critical intel of the night.

**Ophelia:** "So uncle, about those soldiers moved to the north... the resistance is stronger than expected."
**Duke:** "Yes, it seems someone escaped and was able to rally them... I thought you (Reeves) said the Lighthouse handled it."
**Reeves:** "We had it... not sure what happened, someone broke in and freed the subject... You'd think those **Shadowed** would be a little more afraid of the light. A few **new models** would make short work of them."
**Ophelia:** (Feigning shock with a fan)
**Reeves:** "Eduard, I know your... companion has been quite interested and has connections to this."
**Eduard:** "Don't worry about Ellara, she's more pious than the light itself. If I tell her what to do, she'll do it. **I have been watching her. She will do as expected.** Enough of these unpleasantries, I must go find her."
**Reeves:** "Ollie, I think I have a new plaything for tonight."

Berridin checked on Ysidor, who was surrounded by empty glasses but surprisingly sober (**Con Save 16**). He tried to find Witty (missed him) and then saw Reeves approach Nyx.

## 5) The Afterparty — The Lion's Den

**Reeves:** "So you're still here. You didn't leave."
**Nyx:** "I'm a man of my word."
**Reeves:** "There's a little afterparty. Would you like to attend?"
**Nyx:** "...Yeah, I think it'd do me some good."

Berridin saw this but chose not to interfere (**Insight 17** vs Nyx's Performance).

Nyx was led to a private quarter. Reeves began unbuttoning his shirt, exposing his chest.
**Reeves:** "It's been a while since I saw Whitman boys... I know I was a bit older but we did run in the same circles."
Nyx gave a low chuckle. Reeves opened a door to a massive room where **Grand Duke Valerian Oleander** waited, sleeves rolled up, with an amber drink.
**Reeves:** "Ollie, I brought a gift... This little one." (He wrapped an arm around Nyx from behind, finger on his face). "He tried to trick us."
**Duke:** "**What is it this time, my sweet?**"

They deconstructed the "Whitaker" ruse immediately. They knew Witty was real, but suspected the brothers were fakes.
**Reeves:** "The Whitmans... I don't know them well but there is nothing under the light that would bring the **4th son** to Bastion City... That *was* Witty but... who are you? What brought you?"
**Nyx:** (Stony-faced) "What makes you think I'm not his brother?"
**Reeves:** "Like I said, everything Witty wants is the love of his family... 1 and 2 would be too obvious. The **4th son** got away from the family, it's harder to get further to **Boaden**, the chances are very very high you aren't that."
**Nyx:** (Exhaling, dropping the act) "He is a sweet kid indeed... I thought something like this would happen. I **am** his brother... I wanted some information so here I am. But you've drawn me out."
**Reeves:** (**Insight 13 vs Deception 8**) "Interesting if true... So you're just using the brother for something else... I'm sure you do. I'm the Director of Relations at the Lighthouse."
**Nyx:** "I've heard whispers of a situation... about the use of **Shadowed** to power our entire city."
**Reeves:** "Our city is not powered entirely by shadows, what do you mean?"
**Nyx:** "That's the whispers I have heard."
**Reeves:** "All the way up in Boaden that's what you heard? ... The Shadowed, maybe not the most orthodox thing, but they are a **convenient boogeyman**... nothing in the light would be as dark as that. It's just fearmongering and ignorance."
**Nyx:** "You'd know best."
**Reeves:** "Is that all, Whitaker the 4th? Well then you and your 'brothers' can go home. I have a Duke to take care of. Don't slam the door on the way out."

Nyx was escorted out by a guard.

## 6) Regrouping

**Ellara & Eduard:**
Eduard found Ellara.
**Eduard:** "Sister Ellara, it's time to return to seminary."
**Ellara:** "It was so nice to see Eulogia so prominent in the Ducal family."
**Eduard:** "Yes, Ophelia has been devout since a young girl... But tell me, I saw you talk to Donnathan and the Duke—were you able to find out anything more about what happened?"
**Ellara:** "Donnathan mentioned a ruckus at the Lighthouse... but he assured me they are investigating."
**Eduard:** "Good. There are no saints. Some give in to their shadowed nature... It is not a race, my child. With enough light and water, the plant will grow."

**The Boys:**
Berridin found Nyx outside. They grabbed Ysidor and huddled to compare notes.
**Nyx:** "I met Oleander and Reeves. They suspected me... I asked them directly about the Shadowed powering the light crystals. They denied it... but Donnathan lied. They are suspicious of all of us."
**Berridin:** "So just to be clear... you didn't actually score?"
**Nyx:** "No, I don't swing that way."
**Berridin:** "Okay good... I managed to overhear a call between the 4 most powerful people in the city. They are aware that **Meri** instigated a rebellion that's slowing them down. She's a thorn in their side. Everyone seems to be aware... the Duke, the niece, Reeves, and **Proctor Eduard**. They're all super racist against Shadowed. But I really don't think Eduard is as good as Ellara makes him seem. He basically said he has Ellara wrapped around his finger."
**Nyx:** "That much is certain."

## 7) The Morning After

**Witty:** Woke up at Lady Jacintha's, bruised and sore but happy. Jacintha fed him breakfast ("extra breakfast for you, young sir") and asked for gossip.
**Jacintha:** "It looks like your brother tried to flirt with the heiress but to no avail, as **Proctor Eduard's guest** sought her companionship instead. Maybe you'll have more gossip for me."
Witty realized he should check his home.

**Nyx:** Checked his underworld drop spots. He found a new commission: **A stylized black swan**. It was a request for the head of the leader of the stone goliaths in **Hyrta** (Meri). **Price: 250 gold.**

On the street, Nyx found a lost Witty in purple robes.
**Nyx:** "It's me, Alexander." (Winks)
**Witty:** "Ah Mr Alexander... I seem to have lost my clothes, do you know where my tailor is?"
**Nyx:** "No, but I can lead you home."

## Where We Stand

| Thread | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **The "Whitaker" Cover** | **Burned.** Reeves and the Duke know/suspect the brothers are frauds. Witty is likely safe but the others are marked. |
| **The Conspiracy** | Confirmed collusion between **The Duke**, **Reeves**, **Ophelia**, and **Eduard**. They are aware of the resistance and the "new models" (warforged). |
| **Ellara's Position** | Eduard believes she is a pawn ("wrapped around his finger"). Ellara believes Eduard is trustworthy. |
| **Meri** | Targeted. A **250g bounty** has been placed on her head ("Black Swan"). |
| **The "Shadowed Battery"** | Reeves denied it to Nyx, calling it "fearmongering," but Berridin's eavesdropping confirms they are frustrated by the resistance slowing them down. |

**Next Steps:**
*   Deal with the bounty on Meri.
*   Navigate the now-dangerous political landscape.
*   Ellara remains unaware of Eduard's true dismissive nature towards her agency.
