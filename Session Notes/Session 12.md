## 1) The Morning After — Bathrobes and Briefings

Nyx led Witty home through the early morning streets to the Whitaker estate, where everyone but Ellara had gathered. Witty, still riding the lingering haze of the previous night, announced his immediate priority: *"I need to bathe."*

He walked straight toward the bathroom, disrobing as he went—coat dropped at the door, shirt in the hallway—until by the time he reached the bathroom, he was completely naked save for a **purple shower cap** and a **loofah**. Nyx closed the front door that Witty had, predictably, left wide open.

Ysidor watched Berridin begin eyeing the silver and paintings around the estate, mentally appraising each piece. Nyx sat down, confirmed with Witty they could "grab whatever," and activated the sending stone so Ellara could listen from the Seminary.

## 2) The Black Swan — A Contract for Meri

Nyx laid out the situation: on one of the contract boards for bounty hunters, a patron called the **Black Swan**—anonymous, reliable, known for difficult high-risk/high-reward jobs—had posted a bulletin. Someone put a hit out on **Meri**. The wording was vague enough that "removal" could mean anything, and the price was **250 gold**.

**Nyx:** "I say we take the contract. Others have seen it too. We get the gold, rescue her—kill two birds with one stone. They want her to disappear. We get her to safety, and if she doesn't show up again, we're good."

Ellara, raising her hand invisibly over the stone: *"We both met the same Meri, right? She won't stop fighting for her people."*

Berridin tossed his sending stone to Ysidor to contact Meri directly.

**Ysidor:** "How does this work again... **Meeeri??** Ding ding ding!"

After fumbling sounds: **Meri:** "Little hill?"

What followed was a masterclass in miscommunication. Ysidor warned her that "black swans are coming to kill you." Meri replied that they don't usually get swans up there, but they're easy to get rid of. Ysidor suggested "maybe these are city black swans." Then he said bye and handed the stone to Nyx.

Nyx explained properly: the Black Swan was a person, not a bird, and they'd posted a well-paid job to remove her by name. Meri connected the dots—an army of about **20 soldiers** had been encamped nearby for days under a **ducal decree**, and she'd returned because the Grand Duke was using force to access the mountains.

**Berridin:** "Hey mommy, it's Berridin."
**Meri:** "I'm not your mother, little one. First of all. *Sigh*... Of course Little Hill would make friends like this."

She estimated they could handle the 20 soldiers, but it seemed like a strange opening move. Berridin warned her that more powerful reinforcements were likely coming. Travel time to reach her: **a few weeks**.

### The Rubber Ducky Interlude

The bathroom door swung open. Witty, covered in suds, stuck his head out.

**Witty:** "Has anyone seen my rubber ducky?"
**Berridin:** "Yes, it's on the mantle."
**Witty:** "Who are you talking to?"
**Meri:** (through the stone) "I'm Meri."
**Nyx:** "The adults are talking."

Witty closed the door.

## 3) Planning the Journey — Hot Air and Hard Math

Berridin (**Intelligence Dirty 1**) tried to calculate travel logistics with warforged on the way. His mind wandered entirely. Ellara asked the obvious question: why couldn't Meri just come to them?

Witty emerged in undergarments, offering to call a carriage. When asked if he had horses, he admitted he hadn't seen them since Jarvis left. Berridin suggested asking Lady Jacintha—and also checking if she had a hot air balloon.

As Berridin mindlessly started picking up Witty's dropped clothes, he caught himself and threw them back down.

**Witty:** "Just so you know, I like them ironed and pressed for next time."

### Lady Jacintha Redux

At Jacintha's estate, the servant announced: *"Madam, your... friend from last night has returned."*

Jacintha, still in night clothes, was delighted by the visit—less so by the request. She directed them to **Dunston & Kirk's** for hot air balloons, estimating a cheap one at around **100 gold**. Somewhere across the city, Nyx felt a chill run down his spine.

When Witty mentioned paying Berridin 20 gold a month, Jacintha's concern sharpened.

**Jacintha:** "Darling, we spoke of this—no servant is worth that much. I would be careful of your company; he seems to be a swindler."
**Witty:** "I trust him with my life."
**Jacintha:** "Then you are a fool, and a fool and his money will soon be parted."

The servant motioned them to leave. Witty called back: "Call me." Jacintha: "Surely."

### The Servant's Leave of Absence

Walking away, Berridin learned Witty only had **25 gold** on hand.

**Berridin:** "I thought I was gonna attach myself to you and get rich quick, but it seems I'm going back to my original benefactor—Nyx. I'm taking a leave of absence."
**Witty:** "Can you still make me suits?"
**Berridin:** "We'll see."

## 4) The Balloon Budget Crisis

Back with the group, the financial reality set in.

**Witty:** "I'm money poor. I'm just a billionaire down on his luck."

Ellara, alarmed over the stone: *"What do you mean hot air balloon? Like in the sky? How does that work? Is that safe?"*

Witty explained: wind and heat. Depending on conditions, travel time could range from a week to six months. They examined a map covered in pins marking Witty's favorite places.

**Nyx:** "So you don't have a plan."
**Witty:** "We have a **concept of a plan**."

### Travel Calculations

* **Nyx** (**Survival 16**): Four weeks on foot (northwest). Carriage: two weeks. A large army or warforged transport would take around four weeks or longer.
* **Witty** cut a lock of Berridin's hair, threw it out the window to judge the wind, and ran calculations (**Intelligence with Advantage: 12**). With favorable winds, a balloon would also take around two weeks. Without favorable winds? Who knows.

Berridin pitched the balloon hard—telling Ysidor he had "one element left to conquer" in the skies, and Nyx that it was a great place to "flex his fancy wardrobe." Ellara countered that unfavorable winds meant not making it at all.

Then Witty offered the innovation that broke everyone's brains:

**Witty:** "So could we procure some horses and hang them from ropes from the hot air balloon? So if it happens, we have an additional option—or we can float just high enough off the ground?"
**Berridin:** "Holy shit."

Nyx relented. He'd go along with the balloon plan—but warned Berridin to get the cheapest price, and not to skim.

**Witty:** "I really trust him. He's been of the highest level of integrity. Never lied to me once."

Nyx walked over, put a hand on Witty's shoulder: *"You're a good guy."* Then walked away.

## 5) Dunston & Kirk's — Bespoke Disappointment

The workshop was a sensory assault: gnomes, dwarves, halflings, and elves working amid the clang of blacksmith hammers, the smell of oil and metal. A dwarf manned the counter.

Witty's first word: "Purple." The dwarf noted purple was more expensive. Nyx started to object; Witty overrode him with "Cost is no issue."

The dwarf explained: this was a **bespoke** facility. Balloons cost **200 gold**, took several weeks. Propulsion research would add **50-100 gold** and more time. The fastest turnaround: **4 weeks**.

Berridin asked about existing inventory.

**Dwarf:** "We. Are. A. Bespoke. Place."

**Witty:** "Any existing orders with purple?"

**Luck Check: 64** (needed 5 or less). No.

Berridin tried everything—loaners, horse-pulled floating carriages, paragliding, post-sale upgrades. The dwarf shut each down with increasing irritation: *"We are not the Duskbreaker Lighthouse. We are a facility that creates devices. No R&D."*

Witty, helpfully: "Can we steal someone's hot air balloon?"

Nyx ended it: soldiers would reach the village before the balloon was even ready. They thanked the dwarf and left.

## 6) Ellara's Farewell

Ellara went to the Seminary to gather her things and found **Proctor Eduard**.

**Ellara:** "I might have to be away for a while. Related to the goliath business. I will continue my studies on the way."
**Eduard:** "I understand. You do add a lot to the seminary, but I understand the calling. Go forth—you have my blessing."

He handed her a book: ***Josephine's Insights on the Nature of Eulogia*** (early church theology).

**Ellara:** "Wow. I won't misplace your trust."

---

## 7) The Carriage Haggle

The group rented horses and a carriage.

* **Starting price:** 30 gold.
* **Berridin:** "How about 20?"
* **Dwarf:** "28."
* **Berridin:** "Meet me in the middle at 24."
* **Dwarf:** "26."
* **Berridin:** "Deal."

**Nyx:** "I heard the whole thing. 26 it is."

Berridin quietly pocketed the **4 gold difference** as a "finder's fee."

---

They left the city. It was late afternoon.
