## 1) The Morning After — Bathrobes and Briefings

Nyx led Witty home through the pale early-morning streets to the Whitaker estate, where everyone had already regrouped—everyone except Ellara, who stayed at the Seminary with her sending stone.

The moment they arrived, Witty announced his first priority with absolute clarity: **“I need to bathe.”**

He immediately marched toward the bathroom while undressing in real time—coat abandoned at the door, shirt dropped in the hallway—until he reached the bathroom **completely naked**, save for a **purple shower cap** he set on his head and a **loofah** clutched like a scepter. True to form, Witty had left the front door standing wide open behind him; Nyx quietly stepped over and **closed it**.

Ysidor watched Berridin’s eyes drift toward the estate’s silver and paintings, doing the kind of mental math that doesn’t require a calculator—just a lack of shame.

Nyx sat with the group, glanced toward the bathroom hall, and said, half-reporting and half-praying:
**Nyx:** “I think he’s gonna take a bath…?”
To Witty, through the open doorway: **“Can we grab whatever?”**
**Witty:** “Make yourself at home.”

Nyx then activated the sending stone so Ellara could listen in as the morning’s real problem landed on the table.

---

## 2) The Black Swan — A Contract for Meri

Nyx explained that on one of the bounty-hunter contract boards, a patron called the **Black Swan** had posted a bulletin. The Black Swan’s identity was unknown, but their reputation wasn’t: **reliable**, **serious**, and associated with **high-risk, high-reward work** that other hunters paid attention to.

Someone had put a hit out on **Meri**.

The wording was vague—**“remove”** rather than **“kill”**—the kind of phrasing that could plausibly mean *disappear, relocate, silence, abduct,* or *assassinate,* depending on who read it. The payout was **250 gold**.

**Nyx:** “I say we take the contract. Others have seen it too. We get the gold, rescue her—kill two birds with one stone. They want her to disappear. We get her to safety, and if she doesn’t show up again, we’re good.”

Ellara, listening remotely, raised her hand *into the air no one could see.*
**Ellara:** “We both met the same Meri, right? She won’t stop fighting for her people.”

Berridin tossed his sending stone to Ysidor, who—at Berridin’s insistence—attempted to “make it work” by being loud.

**Ysidor:** “How does this work again… **Meeeri??** Ding ding ding!”

After fumbling stone-noises:
**Meri:** “Little hill?”
**Ysidor:** “Meri! It’s me, Ysidor.”
**Meri:** “Little hill? The stone you gave me started making noise. I guess this is how it works.”

Ysidor tried to deliver the warning and instead invented an ornithological crisis.

**Ysidor:** “We have news that black swans are coming to kill you.”
**Meri:** “We usually don’t get swans up here, but they’re easy to get rid of.”
**Ysidor:** “Maybe these are city black swans. I don’t get it either.”

Nyx physically winced and reached for the stone.
**Nyx:** “Can I explain it?”
**Ysidor:** “Bye, Meri.”

Nyx took the stone.

**Nyx:** “Hello, Meri.”
**Meri:** “You’re… Nyx, right?”
**Nyx:** “Yeah. I figured I could give a better overview. The Black Swan is a person, not a bird. I’m a bounty hunter—I saw a job posted to remove you, by name. The good news is it said ‘remove,’ not ‘kill.’ We wanted you to know, and to talk about what we can do.”

Meri didn’t sound surprised—more like someone whose suspicions had finally been handed a receipt.

**Meri:** “That would explain all these men. There’s been a sitting army not far away—encamped for a few days, haven’t done much. Something about a **ducal decree**. Same reason I came back. Looks like this Grand Duke isn’t taking no and is using force to get access to the mountains.”

Nyx’s conclusion came fast and sharp.
**Nyx:** “Honestly… the Black Swan is probably the Duke.”

Berridin leaned into the stone like it was a family dinner.

**Berridin:** “Hey mommy, it’s Berridin. How many men did you spot?”
**Meri:** “I’m not your mother, little one. First of all. *Sigh.* Of course Little Hill would make friends like this… By my reckoning, about **20 soldiers**, but they haven’t moved yet.”

Berridin immediately shifted into threat assessment.

**Berridin:** “At their strength levels, how much of a threat are they?”
**Meri:** “We could probably take out most of them. But it would be a strange strategy to come out with only twenty.”

**Berridin:** “You’ve been a thorn in their side. I think they’re going to send more powerful reinforcements.”
**Meri:** “Depending on what you mean… yes? We’re just a small village at the foot of the mountain.”

**Berridin:** “How long would it take us to reach you?”
**Meri:** “A few weeks.”

### The Rubber Ducky Interlude

The bathroom door cracked open. Witty—still wet, sudsy, and offended by the world—stuck his head out.

**Witty:** “Has anyone seen my rubber ducky?”
**Berridin:** “Yes. It’s on the mantle.” (…and he had no idea why he’d said that so automatically.)
**Witty:** “Who are you talking to?”
**Nyx:** “Meri.”
**Witty:** “Who’s Meri?”
**Meri:** “I’m Meri.”
**Nyx:** “She’s Ysidor’s mentor.”
**Witty:** “Are they happy?”
**Ysidor:** “She’s content, I would say.”
**Witty:** “Sounds cheery.”
**Berridin:** “Go finish your bath.”
**Nyx:** “The adults are talking.”

Witty closed the door.

## 3) Planning the Journey — Teleportation, Horses, and Hard Math

Berridin tried to do travel logistics and immediately suffered a catastrophic system failure.

* **Berridin (Intelligence: Dirty 1):** His mind wandered off a cliff, returning only with vague dread about getting there “on time,” especially if warforged transport complicated the region.

Ellara asked the obvious question from across the stone:
**Ellara:** “Why do we need to go there? Why can’t she just come here?”

Witty stuck his head out and offered, bright as a man who’d never paid for anything himself:
**Witty:** “I can call a carriage.”

Ysidor, ever helpful:
**Ysidor:** “We should go to my village. It’s a great village.”

Berridin asked if anyone knew of teleportation.

Ellara’s reaction was immediate, equal parts academic and horrified.

* **Ellara (Intelligence 3):** Teleportation circles sounded insane. She understood the *concept*—in the same way she understood the concept of a dragon politely doing paperwork.

Witty emerged in undergarments, having been idly listening more than anyone expected.

* **Witty (Intelligence 10):** If teleportation existed in any practical sense, it wouldn’t go to *“bumfuck nowhere.”* It would be used for moving the warforged—meaning the party might realistically reach Meri before any large, slow-moving transport.

Then the practical problem landed:

**Berridin:** “Witty, do you have a carriage?”
**Witty:** “Yes. But I’m not sure if I have horses. I haven’t seen them since Jarvis left.”
**Berridin:** “Let’s get horses then.”
**Witty:** “I could ask Lady Jacintha?”
**Berridin:** “Definitely. Also… check if she has a **hot air balloon**?”

As they moved to go, Berridin absentmindedly started picking up Witty’s clothes from the hallway—then froze, realized what he was doing, and threw them back down like they were cursed.

**Witty:** “Just so you know, I like them ironed and pressed for next time.”

---

### Lady Jacintha Redux

Witty and Berridin returned to Jacintha’s estate. A servant announced them with the exhausted dignity of someone living in a soap opera:

**Servant:** “Madam… your… *friend from last night* has returned.”

Jacintha appeared in night clothes, delighted by the visit—until the request surfaced.

**Witty:** “Unfortunately, not coming back for more. I have a favor.”
**Jacintha:** “Oh! A favor? Ooh—ooh—”
**Witty:** “Do you know where I can procure an air balloon?”
**Jacintha:** “Ohhh… they’re all the vogue. If you go to **Dunston & Kirk’s** you might be able to. They’re not cheap.”
**Witty:** “Perfect.” *(he kissed her hand)* “Oh—do you have any horses too?”
**Jacintha:** “It’s only ten minutes away.”

Berridin prodded the critical issue: whether Witty actually had money.

**Witty:** “Yeah, they can charge it to my family’s account.”
Berridin cut that off and asked Jacintha directly:
**Berridin:** “How much would a hot air balloon cost?”
**Jacintha:** “I’m no tinkerer or merchant… but a cheap one? **A hundred gold** or so.”

Somewhere across the city, Nyx felt a chill crawl up his spine.

Then Witty mentioned paying Berridin **20 gold a month**, and Jacintha’s expression sharpened into protective outrage.

**Jacintha:** “Darling, we spoke of this—no servant is worth that much. Din, was it? Are you trying to rob this man blind?”
**Berridin:** “I charge by services procured.”
**Jacintha:** “With all due respect, I would have heard of you.”
**Berridin:** “Among the top servants, discretion is a top value.”
**Jacintha:** “They like to gossip. I would know. I would be careful of your company; he seems to be a swindler.”
**Witty:** “I trust him with my life.”
**Jacintha:** “Then you are a fool—and a fool and his money will soon be parted.”

The servant motioned them out.

**Witty:** “Call me.”
**Jacintha:** “Surely.”

### The Servant’s Leave of Absence

Walking away:

**Berridin:** “How much gold do you have on you?”
**Witty:** “Twenty-five.”
**Berridin:** “How are you gonna keep paying me if you don’t have more gold?”
**Witty:** “We agreed you’d handle expenses.”
**Berridin:** “I thought I was gonna attach myself to you and get rich quick… but it seems I’m going back to my original benefactor—Nyx. I’m taking a leave of absence.”
**Witty:** “Can you still make me suits?”
**Berridin:** “We’ll see.”

Also, for reasons known only to digestion and chaos:

**Berridin:** “How was last night?”
**Witty:** “I had some hits of gas… but I think it went well.”

---

## 4) The Balloon Budget Crisis

Back with the group, Berridin announced they were going to try to procure a balloon.

**Nyx:** “Does anyone here know how to use them?”
**Witty:** “I know about gas. I understand thermodynamics.”
**Berridin:** “Can you make argon somehow?”
**Nyx:** “Oh boy.”

Berridin floated the expected cost.

**Berridin:** “It’ll be around **200 gold**.”
**Nyx:** “I don’t have that kind of funds on me.”
**Witty:** “I’m money poor. I’m just a billionaire down on his luck.”
**Berridin:** “God damn it.”

Ellara, alarmed over the stone:
**Ellara:** “What do you mean hot air balloon? Like in the sky? How does that work? Is that safe?”

Nyx—already suspicious of Berridin’s financial creativity—idly took out a knife and started playing with it like the concept of a *finder’s fee* had a physical form.

**Nyx:** “How big is the basket? Can we fit?”
**Witty:** “Wind and heat, my dear. Depending on the wind—**a week to six months**.”

They went to Witty’s map, covered in pins marking favorite places, which made Nyx’s patience visibly thin.

**Nyx:** “So you don’t have a plan.”
**Witty:** “We have a **concept of a plan**.”
**Nyx:** “Here’s our milquetoast idea: as Mr. Moneybags single-handedly funding this, I need more to go off of.”
**Ysidor:** “Thirty percent stake.”

### Travel Calculations

* **Nyx (Survival 16):**

  * **On foot:** ~4 weeks, northwest
  * **Carriage:** ~2 weeks
  * **Warforged transport:** longer than 4 weeks
  * **Large army movement:** ~4 weeks
  * **Balloon:** depends entirely on winds

Witty performed “research” by cutting a lock of Berridin’s hair and tossing it out a window to judge wind conditions.

* **Witty (Intelligence w/ Advantage 12):** With favorable winds, balloon travel could also be ~2 weeks. Without favorable winds? **Who knows.**

Berridin tried to sell the balloon to each party member like a doomed pitchman:

* To Ysidor: the final element—**the sky**—waiting to be conquered.
* To Nyx: the ultimate runway for **fancy wardrobe flexing**.

Nyx softened, but with a warning.

**Nyx:** “I’m warming to the idea. But if the weather is against us… we could double our time.”
**Ellara:** “If the winds are against you, you’re just not making it.”

Then Witty offered the innovation that broke everyone’s brain:

**Witty:** “So could we procure some horses and hang them from ropes from the hot air balloon? So if it happens, we have an additional option—or we can float just high enough off the ground?”
**Berridin:** “Holy shit.”

Nyx relented.

**Nyx:** “Okay. I’m fine with the hot air balloon. But you gotta get me the cheapest price. And if I find out you’re taking off the top—”
**Berridin:** “I’m ready to haggle.”
**Witty:** “I really trust him. He’s been of the highest level of integrity. Never lied to me once.”

Nyx walked over, put a hand on Witty’s shoulder, and delivered the kindest sentence Witty had ever received.

**Nyx:** “You’re a good guy.”

Then Nyx walked away.

## 5) Dunston & Kirk’s — Bespoke Disappointment

Dunston & Kirk’s was a sensory assault: gnomes, dwarves, halflings, and elves working amid hammer-clang and oily metal smells. At the front counter, a dwarf handled paperwork with the exhaustion of a man who’d recently learned what nobles considered “urgent.”

**Berridin:** “Hello. We’re looking to procure a hot air balloon.”
**Dwarf:** “Yes, yes—we just started taking orders. Seems some of the nobles want to see what all the fuss is about.”

Witty wasted no time.

**Witty:** “Purple.”
**Dwarf:** “Purple does tend to be more expensive.”
**Nyx:** “No we don’t.”
**Witty:** “Cost is no issue.”

They discussed load-bearing needs.

* **Nyx:** estimated **6 or 7** people.
* The dwarf advised an upper practical limit of around **10 humans**.

Nyx requested a darker color. The dwarf didn’t care—color was aesthetic; physics wasn’t.

Berridin asked about propulsion, and the dwarf explained the grim truth:

**Dwarf:** “The gas in the balloon is heated. It rises. That’s… it. You go up, and the wind takes you. You’re at the mercy of the winds.”

Nyx, trying anyway:
**Nyx:** “Is there any way to have forward propulsion?”
**Dwarf:** These were leisure vehicles. Forward propulsion would mean **research**, **time**, and **money**—the kind that turns a balloon into something closer to an airship.

**Dwarf:** “Oh, you want a personal airship? I’m sure you have a few thousand gold for this.”

They asked about deposits.

**Dwarf:** “Usually **20%**.”
A balloon would cost **200 gold**, take **some weeks**.
Propulsion research would add **50–100 gold** and **several more weeks**.
Fastest turnaround?

**Dwarf:** “**Four weeks.**”

Berridin asked if they had anything in stock.

**Dwarf:** “We. Are. A. Bespoke. Place.”

Witty tried one last angle:
**Witty:** “Any existing orders with purple?”

**Luck Check: 64** (needed 5 or less). No.

The dwarf also made it clear existing clients took priority unless they paid dearly for priority.

Ellara, faintly through the stone, sounded like she was watching prophecy unfold:
**Ellara:** “S-see… I think this is a sign we were not meant to go in the air.”

Berridin tried every possible workaround—loaners, upgrades later, floating carriages pulled by horses, paragliding, “most exciting balloon tech,” even putting a deposit down now for an airship later.

The dwarf shut them down with increasing irritation:

**Dwarf:** No post-sale modifications. New contracts only.
**Dwarf:** “We are not the Duskbreaker Lighthouse. We are a facility that creates devices. No R&D.”

Witty, helpfully:
**Witty:** “Can we steal someone’s hot air balloon?”

Nyx ended it.

**Nyx:** “Sorry. This is not going to work. There will be soldiers there by the time the balloon is even ready.”

They thanked the dwarf, and left.

## 6) Ellara’s Farewell

Ellara returned to the Seminary to gather her things and found **Proctor Eduard**.

**Ellara:** “I might have to be away for a while. Related to the goliath business. I will continue my studies on the way.”
**Eduard:** “I understand. You do add a lot to the Seminary—but I understand the calling. Go forth. You have my blessing.”

He handed her a book: ***Josephine’s Insights on the Nature of Eulogia*** (early church theology).

**Ellara:** “Wow. I won’t misplace your trust.”

---

## 7) The Carriage Haggle

They rented horses and a carriage to leave Bastion.

* **Starting price:** 30 gold.
* **Berridin:** “How about 20?”
* **Dwarf:** “28.”
* **Berridin:** “Meet me in the middle at 24.”
* **Dwarf:** “26.”
* **Berridin:** “Deal.”

Nyx, who had listened to the entire performance, deadpaned the coup de grâce:

**Nyx:** “I heard the whole thing. 26 it is.”

Berridin quietly pocketed the **4 gold difference** as a “finder’s fee.”

---

They departed Bastion by carriage in the late afternoon.

---

## End of Session Notes

**Key Intelligence:**

* **The Black Swan** posted a **250 gold** bounty on Meri using ambiguous “removal” language.
* Meri reported an encampment of roughly **20 soldiers** nearby under a **ducal decree**, likely tied to the Grand Duke using force to access the mountains.
* Nyx suspects the **Black Swan may be the Duke**.

**Travel Time Estimates:**

* **On foot:** ~4 weeks (NNW)
* **Carriage:** ~2 weeks
* **Hot air balloon:** ~2 weeks (favorable winds) → **unreliable** / potentially far longer
* **Warforged transport:** longer than 4 weeks
* **Large army movement:** ~4 weeks

**Party Status:**

* **Ellara** received *Josephine’s Insights on the Nature of Eulogia* and Eduard’s blessing to travel.
* **Berridin** declared a “leave of absence” from Witty’s employ; returned to Nyx as benefactor; pocketed **4 gold** from the carriage haggle.
* **Witty** has **25 gold** on hand, no horses, and an extremely confident relationship with thermodynamics.
* **Nyx** is funding the expedition and remains actively suspicious of “fees.”

**Party departed Bastion by carriage, late afternoon.**
