## 1) The Bank Retcon - Igor Whitman II

Witty wanted to withdraw funds from the Whitman estate, so the timeline rewound to show his bank visit with Berridin. The bank was a neoclassical, art deco stone building with bronze work, guards at the door, and a single teller behind a long line.

The teller explained that **Jarvis** had been withdrawing **200 gold weekly**, with the last withdrawal **two weeks ago** draining the account. Witty declared fraud; the teller reminded him the bank cannot revoke access on a client's behalf and Jarvis was still authorized.

Witty tried a different angle: **a loan backed by Lord Whitman**. Berridin agreed to play the part, and Witty conjured a **minor illusion** of his father, **Igor Whitman II** (opalescent rainbow aesthetics). Berridin cast **Disguise Self** and passed with a **Deception 11**. The teller noted lingering magic but accepted it as a noble affectation.

**Loan terms:**
- **1,000 gold** against the estate, **100 gold/month** for **10 months**
- Miss the first payment and the full amount becomes due (estate at risk)
- Anything higher would require a formal evaluation and **Vaselian bank** verification

Witty tried to negotiate **2,000 -> 1,500 -> 1.1k**. The teller stayed at **1,000**. Berridin signed the paperwork (bad handwriting), took the gold, and left with Witty calling him "dad." They joked about carrying the heavy gold, Witty promised a letter to his father, and Berridin decided to hold the funds for now.

## 2) The Money Debate

Back to the evening before the retcon, Witty told the group that Din (Berridin) had the money covered. Nyx pressed for numbers.

- **Witty:** "I have around 25 gold."
- **Nyx Insight:** **19** vs **Berridin Deception 19** (barely believed)
- **Berridin Deception (disadvantage 17)** vs **Nyx Insight (advantage 16)** when Berridin claimed **3,000**

Nyx asked for the minimum ("over 1,000?"). Berridin insisted the money was emergency funding for him and Witty, maybe even a future **zeppelin business**. Ellara argued they could live off the land; Nyx countered that supplies and passage might still be needed.

## 3) First Light and Proctor Eduard

After a long rest, they left at first light. Nyx rode a horse and Ysidor guided the carriage.

- **Animal Handling:** Nyx **12**, Ysidor **15** (Nyx struggled but held the line)
- They passed **sleeping Warforged** along the gate as they left Bastion

In the padded carriage, Berridin confronted Ellara about **Proctor Eduard**. He said he overheard Eduard, the Duke, the Princess, and **Donnathan Reeves** discussing the light crystal situation, and claimed Eduard said Ellara was "wrapped around his finger." Ellara doubted Berridin. Berridin then cast **Disguise Self** to mimic Eduard and reenact the words, rolling **Performance 10**. The GM ruled Ellara could decide whether to believe it, she was not convinced.

## 4) Campfire Stranger - Samantha and the Baby

The road grew rough and wooded. That evening, a young woman appeared from the shadows carrying a baby and asked to share the safety of their fire.

She introduced herself as **Samantha**, said she had been traveling for weeks from Bastion City, and that **little Julia** was her baby. The father was a wealthy man from the **Dupree** family, **Brenton**, who promised her the world and then abandoned them. Nyx stayed silent by the fire but leaned in when he heard the name.

Ellara offered food; Samantha's stomach growled, and she accepted. Ysidor teared up, praising her strength. Witty offered her his seat in the carriage and said he would ride next to Ysidor.

The party joked about demon babies. Samantha kept the baby swaddled and did not want to show the face. Nyx rolled **Investigation 14** and recognized **Disguise Self** and a familiar "industry" signature.

Positions: Samantha between Ellara and Ysidor; Nyx opposite her; Witty between Nyx and Ellara; Berridin between Ysidor and Nyx.

Nyx slowly readied his crossbow and called her out as a bounty hunter, demanding she drop the act.

### **Battle: The Disguised Hunter**

The "baby" was thrown aside; the illusion shattered. The hunter admitted she wanted easy pickings.

**Opening blows:**
- **Hold Person (level 4):** Nyx **14**, Ysidor **20**, Ellara **21 (adv)** - all saved
- **Nyx:** Crossbow **13** (miss)
- **Berridin:** Phantom Hex, double scimitar **14/14** (miss)
- **Ellara:** Moonbeam, **Con save 8**, **9 damage**
- **Witty:** Ray of Sickness **13** (miss), awkward barrel roll to cover
- **Ysidor:** **24** to hit for **9 + 10 smite**

The hunter downed Ellara with a flurry (**24 total**) before Nyx answered with **Hunter's Mark** and a **25** to hit (**4 + 7 dreadful strike + 3 mark**). Berridin popped **Healing Word (13)** and landed a flourish hit.

A follow-up con save effect blinded Nyx and Ellara (**Ellara 4, Nyx 5; Ysidor 22, Witty 23**), but Nyx still hit on a **26**. Berridin landed two of three attacks (**15/18/16**). Witty's **Tasha's Caustic Brew** line saved on **16**.

The hunter nearly scored a **double crit** on Berridin, but **Silvery Barbs** forced a reroll and all strikes missed. Nyx hit again (**18**) and then landed a **nat 20** crossbow shot (**11 + 1 + 6**) to put her on death's door. Berridin finished with a **nat 20** dagger strike, leaping up and pinning her through the eye.

## 5) Aftermath and Warnings

Nyx searched the body and found tools of the trade and a note reading **"Hyrda."** The hunter had been heading to **Meri**. Nyx warned the group that more bounty hunters could be coming.

Ysidor fixated on the baby and began searching. Nyx insisted there was no baby; it was a spell. Berridin admitted the baby fooled him. Witty declared he'd rather be stabbed than let a baby go cold. Nyx laid down a protocol: verify everyone before trusting them.

Ellara nearly broke down by the fire. Nyx rested a hand on her shoulder and called for rest and the group settled in. Witty and Berridin slept in the carriage.

Nyx asked Witty to prepare for future ambushes. Loot was **1d8 gold -> 2 pieces**. The GM noted Witty's **replicate magic item** options (bag of holding, alchemy jug, cap of water breathing, etc.) and that elixirs are a **bonus action**. Witty planned to craft tinker's tools during rest.

## 6) Morning, Prayer, and the Road Ahead

Ellara prayed over the body with Nyx; he told her, "I do bad things, but I'm not a monster." She smiled quietly.

Witty brewed another elixir (**resilience**, with **boldness** from the prior day). On the road, Witty tinkered in the carriage while Ellara read intently.

On the **seventh day**, the party crested a hill and saw **Ysidor's village** in the distance—and a nearby **Grand Duke encampment** with smoke and roughly **20 soldiers**. The session ended with a **level up** for the party.

## Where We Stand

| Thread | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Meri / Black Swan** | The party killed a bounty hunter sent after Meri. A note read **"Hyrda"** and an encampment of **~20 Grand Duke soldiers** sits near Ysidor's village. |
| **Whitman Debt** | Berridin and Witty secured a **1,000g loan** against the Whitman estate (**100g/month**; estate at risk if unpaid). |
| **Eduard & Ellara** | Berridin warned Ellara that Eduard may be complicit with the Duke and Reeves; she did not really believe him. |
| **Ellara's Shock** | This was the first time Ellara saw someone killed up close; she's visibly shaken and trying to reconcile it. |
| **Witty's Prep** | Witty is building tools and elixirs (resilience + boldness) and can now **replicate magic items** to prepare for more ambushes. |

**Next Steps:**
*   Reach Hyrda and assess the Grand Duke's presence near the village.
*   Decide how to handle further bounty hunters targeting Meri.
*   Figure out repayment or leverage for the Whitman loan.
