Nyx/Nyra nyx wakes up, Oa'Kis (the leopard's name) there nested up with her.

As we rest, for some of us, it's a new env. away from home. 

Dream sequence start:

Ysidor: as you rest, memories come back, you're looking for your mentor. A memory comes back, you're outside in your village, before you stands Meri, grey silve skin of the mountain goliath. Grey fading into purple hair in a braid. 

"little hill, hold your form better, keep your guard up"
ysidor: at this point he uses a hammer. he corrects his form and looks up to check if he did it right
She comes at him with her sword. "well done, little hill"
He manages to block. She is not breaking a sweat, at all after like an hour of training.
"some improvement, little hill, maybe you'll be worthy of your weapon. Satisfactory job"
ysidor: "does that mean we're done for the day"
she sighs in disappointment, "... yes, little hill". Before dismissing him, she does a curtsy bow "May Hero walk with you"
ysidor bows back and repeats the blessing.

Dream sequence end.


Still night, at Nyx's. Tsi'Nyra, cuddled with her panther. First time away from home away from hivemind.

Dream sequence start:
She feels an emptiness. Dark. empty. lonely. Searching but intrinsically knows it's a futile search..
No moon in the sky. Dead forest. No sign of life. No mother tree. Roots are unrooted. Aimless, walking, running. Can't find anything. 

dream end:

ellara:

similar dream, stars, faint voices. calling out. stars gleaming, vast sky, millions of stars, shining on you. as if the whispers come from the stars. she feels comforted, confirmation of faith. perception check, crit. nat 20. For the longest time couldn't understand the whispers. In heart of hearts knew it was eulogia. Always intangible. in this dream, for the first time make out words. It's not in the common tongue. Completely different language. Still don't know what is being said but you hear words, now know it's some other language. Completely foreign. She's a little confused by not knowing but not scared. the words echo in her head. She would be able to repeat them if needed even if she doesn't know what they mean.

berridin:

in your enclave. sleeping. what does he see. he in constantly haunted by a singular nightmare. his village burning in the night. all he sees is the flames leaping from each home to home and seeing his friends and family running every which way and always comes back to him. he remembers running away but can't remember the last moments he had with his parents. always feels unfinished. perception check: nat 1. emotions are overwhelming. wake up. he manages to get up quietly. deep breaths. he climbs to a familiar perch high up where he goes to calm down.

----

nyx:

he is in trance. he sees scenes from he can't quite place where, snapshots, things seem familiar. He has a strong association to them. Familiar. Vague. Unconnected. A place he's no longer where he is. Not from here. Strong emotion. Normally wake feeling a bit disquieted but not quite enough to dig into it. Like a thread that when you pull nothing comes out.

---

We all wake with the promise to meet up.

---

Nyx/Tsi'Nyra: Wake in Nyx's place. He makes breakfast. (wealthier than most others but not quite to the point of opulence, not quite off, but somewhat out of place for where he is in East Bastion). The leopard goes into the hallway, it sits across from Nyx as he cooks. Nyx feeds it some ground meat. It chuffs and starts to eat it. Nyra comes out "Good morning"
"want anything for breakfast"
"yes, would love to try anything. breakfast!"
"any dietary restrictions?"
"dietary restrictions??"
she starts helping herself and is very enthusiastic and eager to try new foods. e.g. dips bacon in the jam, mashing foods together.

---

berridin/ysidor: breakfast here is substantially less opulent. busy halfling vibe, they do their own thing to some degree. have breakfast together. it's a close-knit enclave. maybe honey from a neighbor. another has wildberry jam. just as he provides for them he does for them. ysidor gets up and bumps into everything due to the halfing rooms' size as he's a goliath.
ysidor "very... cozy place"
berridin: (it's always been big for me) "thanks, looking over the destruction it took to get here for you but we'll fix it"
ysidor: picks up a tiny (for him) knife and offers to help

---

ellara: wake up in a humble dorm room. part of the seminary section of the eulogian building complex. it's focused on traning neophytes within hieroterra. wake up do morning prayers at first light. she's sees a tall figure, cream robe with burgundy sash with a burgundy sunburst. older man. human. in his 50s. a bit of a beard, silver slicked back hair.
he says "good morning, apprentice ellara"
"salutations, proctor edouard"
"i'm glad some of the acolytes take the morning blessings seriously... some don't anymore..."
<talk about goliath>
"like a moth to a flame, the shadowed are attracted to bastion... they are barbaric"
"all creatures will find redemption in the light"
"will you be at the seminary"
"you do show promise, ellara"
ellara goes to have breakfast, the denmother shows up
"we talked last night, i talked to other denmothers... the shadowed fixer was seen in the west. handsome (for a shadowed)... oh you've never heard of him? there's a shadowed fixer that helps the nobility... reliable.... they outsource dirty work... the eulogia would NEVER though of course... he was seen last night"
"did you find out anything about the goliath lady"
"she was transferred to the western"
"what about the fixer"
roll insight, nat 20 (again). as she describes the fixer, ellara realizes she's describing Nyx.
"doesn't he sound handsome??"
"denmother!"
"don't tell me i haven't had to confiscate the scrolls"
"the scrolls??"
"the romance scrolls other acolytes are carrying i need to confiscate, not all are as strong as you and only study the scriptures."
"i hope you destroy them!"
"of course"
insight check, ellara knows she absolutely keeps them and has read them all.
Season is summeradjacent long days so daybreak to lunch is longish.
she starts heading out towards the meeting ground after apologizing to the Light and promising double study time to make up

nyx forbids nyra from bringing her leopard to help keep a low profile.
