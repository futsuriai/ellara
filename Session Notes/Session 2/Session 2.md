| PC           | What They Dreamt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Rolls / Notes    |

| **Ysidor**   | A living memory of childhood training with his mentor **Marie**, a grey-skinned, silver-to-lilac goliath. She circles him for an hour, correcting his hammer stance—"Hold your guard higher, **little hill**." At the end she offers a curtsey bow and the blessing, "May Hero walk with you." | Normal recall    |
| **Tsi'Nyra** | Her first sleep separated from the mycelial hivemind: a moonless, dead forest where uprooted roots stumble blindly. The psychic emptiness is crushing—a futile search for the mother tree.                                                                                                     | —                |
| **Ellara**   | Beneath an endless firmament she again hears the "whispers of Eulogia." **Nat 20 Perception** lets her distinguish *actual* words—utterly foreign syllables she can reproduce but not comprehend. The words echo in her head, repeatable but meaningless.                                    | Critical success |
| **Berridin** | The perennial nightmare: halfling homes engulfed in flame, parents and friends lost in the chaos. **Nat 1 Will**—he wakes sobbing and climbs a familiar roof perch to steady himself. The nightmare always feels unfinished—he can't remember his last moments with his parents.            | Critical failure |
| **Nyx**      | A half trance of disconnected, emotion-soaked locales that feel familiar but remain out of reach—like grasping a frayed thread that won't unravel. Snapshots of places he's no longer in, not from here.                                                                                     | —                |

### 2 · Morning in East Bastion

* **Nyx's Townhouse**

  * Modestly upscale for East Bastion: polished wood, nice fixtures, but nothing ostentatious. Wealthier than most but not quite opulent—somewhat out of place for East Bastion.
  * Nyx fries eggs, bacon, and ground meat; **Oa'Kis** the leopard crouches in the hall until fed, chuffing appreciatively.
  * **Tsi'Nyra** arrives, delighted to sample "breakfast!" She's confused by the concept of "dietary restrictions" and gleefully experiments—dipping bacon in jam and mashing flavors together with infectious enthusiasm.

* **Halfling Enclave**

  * Community-aided breakfast with fresh honey from neighbors and wild-berry jam. Close-knit enclave where everyone provides for each other.
  * **Ysidor** keeps whacking ceiling beams and bumping into everything; a butter-knife looks child-sized in his massive hands.
  * **Berridin** jokes, "It's always been big for *me*," surveying the destruction and promising repairs later. Ysidor picks up a tiny knife and offers to help.
  * Ysidor deadpans about the "very... cozy place."

* **Eulogian Seminary (West Bastion)**

  * **Ellara** completes dawn prayers in her humble dorm room. **Proctor Eduard** (50-ish, cream robe, burgundy sash and sunburst, silver slicked-back hair and beard) praises her dedication—"I'm glad some acolytes take the morning blessings seriously... some don't anymore."
  * He sneers about goliaths: "Like moths to a flame, the Shadowed are drawn to Bastion—they are barbaric." 
  * Ellara replies evenly, "All creatures will find redemption in the Light."
  * Later the **Denmother** brings rumours while blushing about confiscated romance scrolls:

    1. A *"handsome—for a shadowed"* fixer doing nobles' dirty work in West Bastion—reliable for outsourced dirty work.
    2. Marie the goliath was transferred to "the western" prison.
    3. Confiscated *romance scrolls* are *absolutely* being destroyed (Denmother clearly keeps and reads them all).
  * **Nat 20 Insight**—Ellara recognizes the "fixer" as Nyx from the description.
  * "Doesn't he sound handsome??" "Denmother!"

Ellara, running late after promising double study time to make up for leaving, hurries across Stone-span Bridge.

### 3 · Rendezvous & Bridge-crossing

* **Leopard banned:** Nyx persuades Tsi'Nyra to leave Oa'Kis free-roaming the rooftops to maintain a low profile.
* **Berridin** disguises **Ysidor** with kit + cantrip, reshaping the goliath into a tall human dubbed **"Moose."**
* The party crosses the 400-m wrought-iron bridge *westward*: opulent façades, crystal street-lamps, parasol-bearing servants—first sight of West Bastion for Tsi'Nyra and "Moose," who gawk like tourists.
* Ellara keeps side-eyeing Nyx: *Is he really that "handsome fixer"?*

---

### 4 · Prison-Crawl

#### Prison #1 – Small Watch-House

* Guard drawls, "Here for work, shadowed?"
* Nyx slips a coin but fumbles the pass (**poor Sleight of Hand**).
* Ellara, oblivious to the bribery, suggests *lavender tea* for the guard's poor memory.
* Meager payoff—"Try Eighth Avenue; someone like that *might* be there."

---

#### Prison #2 – *Stonewall Tower*

* Cylindrical, three stories, single adamant door.
* Guard opens with, "You know how this works, shadowed."
* Nyx starts with silver; bribe escalates to three gold pieces—"Golden fogs," the guard smirks.
* Even then he only admits: "She was here until a month ago. Got moved. My job's on the line if more leaks."

##### The Plan Forms

* Party huddles to strategize—the guard clearly knows more but won't talk for any price.
* Berridin suggests checking prison records while others keep the guard distracted.
* "There's got to be a ledger or transfer documents inside," he whispers.
* Plan: Berridin goes invisible to slip inside and search for documentation while the others maintain the conversation outside. Ellara will chide the guard and Nyx for their immoral behaviour with bribes.

##### Inside (Simultaneously)

* **Berridin** casts *Invisibility* and slips past the counter. **Investigation 15** reveals the leather ledger. He theatrically flutters a page as if a "gust of wind" caused it and copies:

> **Custody Transfer—His Holy Eminence Proctor Eduard.**

##### Outside Side-scene

* A pastry hawker lures Tsi'Nyra and Ysidor to a café, pressing menus insistently.

  * Vendor: "A nice drink for your companion?"
  * Ysidor (deadpan): "I… don't have a stomach."
  * They escape, pastry sample half-eaten, vendor bewildered.

##### Guard Confrontation

* With Berridin still inside searching, the conversation outside grows tense.
* Ellara, stepping in once more money changes hands as the plan dictated: "This is wrong—taking bribes, moving prisoners in secret!"
* The guard's demeanor shifts from smugly transactional to threatening.
* He clamps his hand over her mouth, leaning in close: "Listen, girl. The world is bigger than you think."
* She continues saying that taking the money but not providing a service is deeply against the Eulogia's teachings. Gets a good persuasion roll so he relents.
* There are *people much higher* pulling these strings—especially for a shadowed like her." You don't want to dig too deep, he implies and says if they ask too much more he'll move this up the chain.
* "Light guide your steps", Ellara says in parting.
* Nyx, reading the dangerous shift in mood, intervenes with diplomatic smoothness: "You've given us *plenty* to ponder. Good day."

### 5 · Back on the Street

* Nyx teases Ysidor about the café: "They'd have bled you dry."
* Ysidor, wiping crumbs: "And I *still* don't have a stomach."
* Ellara, cheeks burning: "I haven't done subterfuge like this since I was a child when I tried to sneak Lyra out without Abbot Aris noticing."
* Nyx: "You did well."

**Berridin rejoins**, ledger scrap in hand.

* "Found it. Marie was transferred—under *personal* custody of Proctor Eduard."
* Ellara freezes. "Surely… you made a mistake?"

### 6 · Where We Stand

| Thread                  | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Marie's Whereabouts** | Last recorded under Proctor Eduard's direct custody; destination unlisted.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Church Involvement**   | Proctor Eduard personally involved—but in what capacity? The "people much higher" pulling strings suggest deeper corruption.                                                                                                                  |

### 7 · Where We are Going

1. **Shadow or confront Proctor Eduard**—need to find out more about what he's planning and his connection to Marie's transfer
2. **Investigate who is pulling the strings**—who are these "higher up people" and how are they connected to Marie?

The Light's gilded façade now shows cracks; what pours through—illumination or further shadow—depends on the choices ahead.
