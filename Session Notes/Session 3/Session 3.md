## Session 3 – *Shadows on the Road*

**Season:** High Summer, Year 651 AE
**Locales:** The Drunken Goose tavern (West Bastion) · Eulogian Seminary · East Gate of Bastion City · The Old Trade Road

---

### 1 · The Seminary Confrontation

The party faced a crucial decision: whether to directly confront Ellara's mentor, Proctor Eduard, about his connection to Meri's disappearance. The debate revealed their different approaches to truth-seeking.

**The Disagreement:**
- **Ellara** believed in the direct approach: "It's the right thing to do"—ask Eduard straight out about Meri's fate
- **Nyx** urged caution: "If he is involved, why would he tell you? Maybe he'll deny it. If you reach out, it'll make finding the truth more difficult. I'm speaking from experience—we should find out on our own."
- **Ysidor** offered sage wisdom: "You should always trust your elders"

**The Plan:**
When Ellara insisted she could handle the conversation without lying, Nyx expressed concern: "You don't want to lie—it'll put you in a bad situation. He will press on this. You'll have to say you were at the guardhouse, at the prison. Are you going to lie?"

Ellara's response was firm: "I don't want to lie."

This led to Nyx's deeper worry: "I'm concerned you will tell him everything we've done. He knows you'll tell him everything."

**At the Seminary:**
As evening approached, the party reached the seminary. Recognizing the delicacy of the situation, they agreed to split up:
- **Ellara** would speak to Eduard alone
- The others would wait at **The Drunken Goose** tavern

Nyx assured her, "I'll be able to blend in more at The Drunken Goose," though he warned: "There's a 50/50 chance we never see her again."

Moose (disguised Ysidor) offered parting advice after Berridin told him the Seminary was a sex dungeon: "Please use protection."

Ellara, confused: "I don't think that will be necessary."

### 2 · At The Drunken Goose

**The Tavern:**
A five-minute walk from the seminary gate, The Drunken Goose served the artisan, soldier, and working-class folk of West Bastion—people of similar financial standing to Nyx, though the seminary might consider it "seedy" or "worldly." It was a classic "grab a table, grab your drinks" establishment.

**Drinking Adventures:**
- **Nyx** asked for mead, putting the round on his tab
- **Berridin** approached the bar: "Four pints please." When asked what kind, he confidently declared, "Whatever is in this oak barrel"
- They carried heavy mugs back, spilling a bit on the way. (No mead was obtained)

**Tsi'Nyra's First Drink:**
The mycelial ranger had never tried alcohol before. Her first sip reminded her of "the long grass, of sitting in the sun"—that ferment-y smell wasn't unpleasant. She'd been documenting her experiences in her journal, but the ale hit differently. **Con save 10 (rolled 7) – failure.** Her skin began to tingle with calmness and jitteriness, like spending all day in the sun. She felt energized, maybe a bit tipsy, and started to giggle.

**Berridin's Intervention:**
Berridin, despite his small stature, was "going to town" with his pint. Moose, ever the responsible guardian, declared, "You're too young to drink," and confiscated Berridin's mug. He went to the bar requesting apple juice.

The barkeep was not amused: "We don't run tabs here, and your friend did not tip."

Nyx smoothly handed over the money. Moose returned with apple juice, which Berridin begrudgingly enjoyed, while Moose claimed the extra ale for himself.

### 3 · Ellara's Investigation

**The Ritual:**
Before visiting Eduard, Ellara retreated to her dorm room. She touched a small river stone and whispered, "Wish you were here to help me," performing a small ritual for guidance and strength.

**The Conversation:**
Ellara knocked on Eduard's office door. When he asked what he could do for her, she posed a careful theological question:

*"If a lantern-keeper shifts a great candle into a side chamber before dawn and later swears the flame never left the hall, has he served the Light—or hidden it?"*

Eduard, recognizing the deeper meaning, asked, "What is this really about?"

Ellara's direct approach: "The goliath this morning—why didn't you bring it up?"

**Eduard's Response:**
Eduard admitted he'd looked into it after their earlier conversation: "I set her free after talking to her."

Ellara was delighted: "That's great!"

He explained: "She was concerned about her village, but she's now on her way home."

**The Details:**
- The incident occurred near the Duskbreaker Tower during some research
- "Those shadowed, you know how they are, and she panicked"
- Meri had left that morning and should be "half a day away"
- Her village was "named after some blasphemous deity"

**The Warning:**
As Ellara prepared to leave, Eduard offered cryptic counsel: "Not all that you hear in the shadows is the truth. The shadows may deceive and are not the language of the light."

When Ellara asked about what language Nites spoke, Eduard replied, "An older form of common."

"Why?" she pressed.

"Oh, I just felt like there was another."

"Like I said, the shadows can deceive."

### 4 · The Journey Begins

**Reunion at the Gate:**
The slightly tipsy group reunited at the east gate, where Ellara shared the good news.

"Good news!" Nyx announced as she approached.

Ellara nodded happily: "Your mentor was freed today, Master Ysi—Moose."

**Ysidor's Joy:**
Ysidor was ecstatic: "I need to go find her!"

**Planning the Pursuit:**
- **Distance:** Ysidor's village was "next to my home... it took me like a month to get here from there"
- **Meri's head start:** Half a day on foot
- **Their advantage:** Horses could potentially catch up to someone on foot

**Berridin's Drunken Wisdom:**
Still slurring slightly, Berridin declared, "We should head out NOW!"

**Transport Discussion:**
Nyx asked Ellara, "Have you ridden a horse?"

"Of course," she replied, then observed, "You look like you're wearing too fine clothes to not use a carriage."

**Ellara's Reluctance:**
When Nyx asked if she was coming, Ellara hesitated: "I'm a student. What would you need me for?"

Berridin, still tipsy, slurred suspiciously: "Do-do you really trust this guy? That his mentor is heading home?"

Ellara's firm response: "Of course. He wouldn't lie to me with a direct question."

**Ysidor's Invitation:**
The goliath enthusiastically invited her: "You should come too! You can see my house and try our food. They might hold a festival to the goddess for you!"

Ellara, rubbing her forehead in contemplation, recognized the opportunity: "This might be an opportunity (to convert)."

**The Agreement:**
They planned to meet at the east gate at first light.

### 5 · Preparations for Departure

**Ellara's Evening:**
- The Denmother commented on her late night: "You're up late."
- Ellara explained: "I need to sleep early to help others find the light in a journey."
- The Denmother shared: "I was lucky enough to do it in Ordonne."
- Ellara packed essentials: a pouch, a letter, herbs, her river stone, and supplies
- She wrote a letter before sleeping

**The Others' Preparations:**
- **Nyx** to **Tsi'Nyra:** "Just grab what you came with. I'll get ready."
- **Berridin and Ysidor:** The disguise wore off, and they squeezed into the cramped halfling accommodations for the night

---

### 6 · Dawn Departure

**The Journey Begins:**
As the crystal lamps extinguished with the rising dawn, the party assembled at the east gate. Ysidor was practically vibrating with excitement at the prospect of reuniting with his mentor.

**Healing Capabilities:**
Before departure, they confirmed their group's healing resources:
- **Ysidor:** Raised his hands, which glowed with divine energy
- **Ellara:** "The Light can heal"
- **Nyx:** "I can heal"

**Transportation:**
They rented a carriage, though Ellara chose to ride alongside. Her **Animal Handling (rolled 7)** showed some initial difficulty—the horses spooked at first, but eventually settled into a steady pace.

**The Road:**
The main road was well-travelled and graveled, winding through fields, trees, and farms that gradually gave way to wilder country as they left Bastion's immediate vicinity.

---

### 7 · Religious Discussion

As they traveled, Ellara engaged Ysidor in theological conversation:

**Ellara:** "Can you tell me more about your goddess?"

**Ysidor:** "She's named Hyr. She represents love of any kind—she embraces all and is truly the heart of my village. Every season we braid long grass to each other as a sign of love, then we toss it into the fire and create a new gift." He pulled out such a braid from behind his hair. "This was given to me by my mentor."

**Ellara:** "In Arkos we have similar rituals. How much have you heard of Eulogia?"

**Ysidor:** "Haven't really."

**Ellara:** "Perhaps I'll have to tell you the stories of the pilgrimage... they are quite enlightening." *[She metaphorically "teehee"d at the chance to convert]*

---

### 8 · The Ambush Site

**The Discovery:**
They spotted a campfire ahead on the road.

**Ellara's Assumption:** "That must be your mentor."

**Nyx's Caution:** "Let's be careful."

**Scouting:**
Tsi'Nyra sent **Oa'Kis** the leopard to investigate. The cat, ignoring stealth instructions, bounded ahead enthusiastically, returning five minutes later with disturbing news:

*"Smells metal, foreign, weird metal shapes. No one's there."*

**Tsi'Nyra:** "No human?"

**Oa'Kis:** "Nothing living. Fire just went out."

---

### 9 · The Trap

**Approach:**
They advanced cautiously, spotting three metal figures around the fire. The constructs looked rusted and worn by age.

**Berridin's Investigation:**
The halfling, having stealthed ahead, crept closer for a better look:
- **20 feet:** Something sitting down/slumped
- **10 feet:** Tried to get even closer
- **Perception roll: Natural 1** – In the dim light, he couldn't tell if it was a goliath, but it wasn't moving

**The Activation:**
When Berridin popped his head out and approached openly, the figures stirred. Red eyes blazed to life, and three warforged rose with metallic grinding sounds—nearly as tall as a goliath, constructed of scrap metal.

### 10 · **Battle: Three Rusted Titans**

Mist curled over the dying campfire as Nyx’s opening bolt pinged off a dormant hulk—no mark. Red eyes flared alive; iron torsos unfolded. Tsi’Nyra centered her breath and *first* arrow of the fray **(nat 20)** lanced a glowing eye; its crimson glare guttered. Oa’Kis bounded in; claws scraped uselessly.

Berridin slipped a *phantom hex* onto one, twin blades whistling—both turned aside. Ellara’s guiding bolt flashed wide. The constructs answered by sealing Berridin in a cage of rusted limbs; concussive blows rang his frame, blood darkening his jerkin.

*THOOM.* Ysidor crashed in, hammer detonating radiant force and a smite that blew scale‑flakes of oxidation away; without pausing he poured healing light into the halfling. Ellara watched, unsettled by unfamiliar divinity.

Nyx marked a target and threaded steel through a gap Tsi’Nyra’s crit had opened. Ellara lofted *fairy fire*; violet geometry clung to two chassis—momentum tilted. Still the iron trio ground forward: more punishment into Berridin, a raking sweep at Oa’Kis. Berridin disengaged with a defensive flourish, arcane resonance toughening his guard.

Abandoning pinpoint blasts, Ellara invoked inevitability—*moonbeam* crashed down, argent column hissing through corroded joints and slagging the first titan where it stood. The remaining pair hammered Nyx and Berridin; Ysidor’s smites rang like sanctified anvils; Nyx folded dusk around himself with the Raven Queen’s blessing to intercept a blow.

Attrition mounted: dreadful strikes, arrow punctures, radiant pulses. A second construct staggered under layered wounds; Ellara slid the moonbeam—its crystal core shrieked, then fell silent. One left.

It waded through the lunar glare toward Berridin, mauling him again. He answered with a shaky self‑heal; Nyx’s follow‑up skittered wide **(crit miss)**. For a heartbeat the melee dissolved into clangs and near misses, the last warforged refusing collapse.

Tsi’Nyra felt memory of loam and the hush beneath the Mother‑Tree. She nocked, drew the journey’s purpose into the breath between heartbeats, and released—**(nat 20)**. The arrow knifed a smite‑widened seam, pierced the light‑crystal heart, and the titan folded in a resonant, hollow crash, shards chiming across gravel.

Steam and moon‑motes drifted. No one had fallen—though Nyx and Berridin wore iron’s imprint, divine and arcane mending already knitting flesh. Around them lay dismantled relics—and a ring of new questions cooling with the rust.

---

### 11 · Investigation & Discovery

**Berridin's Findings:**
With a successful investigation, Berridin noticed relief brands on the backs of the constructs – manufacturer's marks. Ellara carefully sketched the symbol.

**Tsi'Nyra's Observation:**
She examined the fire pit, noting it was intentionally constructed for a quick, noticeable fire using needles and leaves. More disturbing were the light cart tracks leading from the direction they'd come – these constructs had been hauled here and positioned as a trap. The party was the first to trigger it.

**Historical Context:**
Berridin and Tsi'Nyra recognized the brand symbol from the lightposts at Bastion. Upon closer inspection, Berridin found broken light crystals within the warforged – they'd been powered by the same technology that lit the city.

**Timeline Assessment:**
The constructs hadn't been here long – they were part of a recent ambush setup.

---

### 12 · Lingering Questions

As the party caught their breath and tended their wounds, several disturbing questions remained:

- **Who set this trap?** The cart tracks suggested it came from Bastion's direction
- **Was this meant for them specifically?** Or was it intended for Meri?
- **What connection exists between the Duskbreaker Lighthouse technology and these warforged?**
- **How did someone acquire and weaponize constructs powered by light crystals?**

The road ahead stretched into uncertainty, but one thing was clear – their journey to find Meri had become far more dangerous than anyone anticipated.
