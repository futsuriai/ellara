### 1 · Aftermath at the Trap Site

As evening settled over the battlefield strewn with warforged remains, the party began to piece together the implications of their discovery.

**Nyx's Analysis:**
"So, the Duskbreaker Lighthouse constructed these and they were just sitting here? One—these were put here as a trap for us. Two—these were put as a trap for *anyone* and we just happened to stumble on it... and why are they making these? Ellara?"

Ellara, studying the metallic corpses, replied honestly: "No, I've never seen anything like this."

"Looks like they were researching, and they're here," Nyx continued.

"Who's 'they'?" Ellara pressed.

"These things—were they put here to attack people?"

"It seems clear they were put here to attack people."

**The Search for Meri:**
**Nyx** (**Perception 15**) noticed what wasn't there—wagon tracks but no wagon, and crucially, no sign of Meri.

When Ellara asked Ysidor directly, "Is there any trace of your mentor here?" the goliath made a thorough search (**Perception 16**) of the entire camp area.

"No, there's nothing to indicate she was here," he concluded.

**The Realization:**
Nyx voiced what they were all thinking: "We are going the right way, right?"

Ysidor's response was telling: "We are, but she wouldn't get injured or captured by these... I don't think she left the city."

Berridin connected the dots: "So this trap was probably not for her?"

"She wouldn't have stealthed around this," Ysidor said with certainty. "She would have beat them."

**The Decision:**
With nothing else to go on, they decided to return to the city as Ysidor suggested, camping at the trap site for the night.

**The Crystal Evidence:**
Nyx collected three light crystals from the wreckage—fist-sized, surprisingly light despite their apparent weight, with a crystalline structure reminiscent of star seeds. His investigation (**roll: 5**) revealed only that they glowed dimly, their secrets remaining locked.

### 2 · Return to Bastion City

**Nightfall Arrival:**
The party returned to Bastion City by nightfall, the contrast stark as they passed beneath the warm glow of the very light crystal lamps that had powered their attackers. The guards offered little trouble at the gates.

**Carriage Return Complications:**
Ellara insisted they return the rented carriage properly. The same rental proprietor who had served them that morning answered her knock.

Nyx: "We're here to return our carriage."

"Everything seems fine."

When Ellara asked what they should do differently, the man replied curtly: "Get here earlier."

"That's not up to us," Ellara protested, but the damage was done.

**Planning the Next Move:**
As they prepared to part ways, Ellara suggested, "It's time for bed. Perhaps tomorrow we should ask Proctor Eduard about those constructs."

"Sure, be careful," Nyx replied.

Ysidor expressed concern: "Are you not worried for your safety? There's some dark magic going on."

"Exactly—who better to ask?" Ellara reasoned.

"If you respect him as your mentor, then I can't say anything about it," Ysidor conceded.

Berridin agreed: "Let's head to you tomorrow morning."

Nyx offered final advice: "Be aware if he says something bizarre. Just be yourself and tell us what you learned. Be yourself."

"I will do," Ellara replied earnestly. "I don't know who else I would be."

Internally, Nyx reflected that this was not how he would have handled the situation at all, but had resigned himself to the approach.

They agreed to meet at the same gate as before, outside the seminary.

### 3 · Morning Preparations

**Domestic Arrangements:**
* **Nyx's townhouse** had effectively become a nest for Tsi'Nyra and her panther companion
* **Berridin and Ysidor** went to gather food from the halfling enclave, where the giant goliath had become a familiar and beloved figure
* **Nyx** embarked on another culinary adventure for breakfast

### 4 · Ellara's Investigation

**Morning Prayers:**
After her morning prayers and meditation, Ellara encountered Proctor Eduard as planned.

"Oh Proctor Eduard, I meant to reach out to you."

"What's up, apprentice?"

**The Report:**
"I went to help reunite the goliaths—for 'When the wandering ember finds again the hearth that first kindled it, both flame and forge grow the warmer, and the Light gains a steadier hue.' We encountered some strange clockwork-like constructs that seemed to be built by the lighthouse."

"What?? If I may—"

Ellara produced a sketch (**Sleight of Hand 15**) she had apparently drawn during the battle, complete with the constructs' insignia.

**Eduard's Reaction:**
"You captured their insignia as well, and you say they attacked you?"

"Yes."

"Duskbreaker Lighthouse... I tried to warn the duke... Sometimes the light can blind itself—they can be blinded by their own ambition. They should be serving the people. These are abominations—"

"They certainly felt that way."

**The Interrogation:**
"I assume your companions are also unscathed. How many were there?"

"Three. If my companions hadn't been battle-hardened..."

"I must take this to the Eulogia. Were you able to reunite the goliaths?"

"No, we saw no sign."

"I did release her, and she was supposed to go home."

"This does not bode well..."

**The Politics:**
When Ellara asked what they should do next, Eduard's response revealed the larger tensions at play:

"This is beyond you... I believe you know the lighthouse and the Eulogia have had a tense relationship. They say we stop their progress."

"Someone must be taken to account!"

"And they will... I have a lot to think about, many letters to write and people to contact."

### 5 · Anxious Reunions

**At the Seminary Gates:**
Ellara was slightly delayed by her conversation. Berridin and Ysidor, growing worried, decided to venture into the seminary grounds to look for her.

When they spotted her approaching, Ysidor ran toward her and enveloped her in a bear hug: "I was so worried you weren't going to be okay!"

Ellara glanced nervously around at the stares they were attracting: "Master Ysidor, you should be a little more careful."

"You were late. You should be more careful. I'm your friend and want to protect you."

"You are very kind. It's like you know the Eulogia already."

After he put her down and they agreed to meet the rest of the group, both Ellara and Berridin noticed that everyone had stopped to stare at their unusual party.

**The Debrief:**
Once reconvened at the gates, Ellara excitedly recounted her discussion with Eduard, emphasizing that the matter would be investigated properly. However, she also mentioned the Proctor's concern that the lighthouse might be involved with Meri's disappearance.

**Ellara's Insight (21):** The Proctor had seemed genuinely upset by the revelations.

### 6 · Unconventional Reconnaissance

**The Problem:**
Both Berridin and Nyx knew the lighthouse was not open to the public, making conventional investigation impossible.

**Tsi'Nyra's Solution:**
The ranger proposed using her spider familiar to investigate the lighthouse—a plan that immediately drew objections from Ellara.

"But the lighthouse is one of the most secure buildings in the city!"

"Well, I was going to use this spider."

"But the Eulogia is going to investigate. Shouldn't we wait? Wouldn't it mess up the proper process?"

Her concerns were largely ignored.

**The Deployment:**
Tsi'Nyra's leopard companion served as transport (**Stealth check: 18**). The spider jumped onto the big cat, which headed out toward the lighthouse with instructions to return to Nyx's apartment when the mission was complete.

### 7 · Lunch and Revelations

**Reluctant Hospitality:**
"Your spider friend knows to come back to my apartment, right? We should go back... to... it..." Nyx said reluctantly, realizing that everyone would now discover where he lived.

Ellara, somewhat unconvinced by the spider plan, found the idea of lunch appealing enough to agree.

**Nyx's Townhouse Revealed:**
Berridin immediately noticed that the interior was much nicer than the exterior suggested—a deliberate mismatch. The main bedroom bore evidence of the panther's presence, with a destroyed bed where the great cat had made itself comfortable.

"Leave the panther alone," Nyx muttered.

Ellara made mental notes of the place's layout and appointments.

**Culinary Disaster:**
Nyx attempted to prepare quiche Lorraine for his guests. Unfortunately, his anxiety about having people in his private space proved distracting:

* **Dexterity roll:** Natural 1 (total: 4)
* **Wisdom roll:** 16

The result was a dish with weird, unappetizing chunks and poor presentation that nonetheless tasted delicious.

"Your presentation is quite... interesting, but it's quite good," Ellara diplomatically observed.

Ysidor attempted to prompt better hosting: "A good host would offer us a drink..."

"I just did!" Nyx protested.

**Berridin's Observation:**
Despite his natural perceptiveness (**Perception: 10**), Berridin didn't notice anything particularly out of the ordinary, though Nyx privately reflected that this was exactly why he hadn't wanted to show people his home.

### 8 · Intelligence Gathered

**The Spider's Return:**
Tsi'Nyra felt a familiar tap on her neck—her arachnid friend had returned with reconnaissance.

**What the Spider Discovered:**
* Extensive metalwork throughout the building
* A basement that went much deeper than expected
* Cold, dark depths filled with insects and spiders
* Strange noises in the depths that the spider hadn't investigated due to time constraints and competition from other insects
* The lighthouse had far more underground space than would be apparent from the surface

**Strategic Discussion:**
"They're manufacturing something... or it's a prison," Berridin concluded. "Ellara, how long do you think the official investigation will take?"

"I assume it'll take a while. It might even be escalated outside the province."

"That'll take too long."

Ellara responded with characteristic wisdom: "The light that burns fastest is not the light that burns brightest."

### 9 · The Moral Crossroads

**Nyx's Proposal:**
"What is happening is that we will go investigate the lighthouse and find our way in to find evidence about Meri. Do you want to come along?"

"I just don't understand how this would work," Ellara replied.

"This sort of thing... I haven't done it specifically... I just do things like this. This is the only way to get headway with Meri, or we'll never hear back—"

"He will definitely get back to us. It might just take a while."

"He has no reason to. You're being optimistic—all you have is faith in him. But that's not evidence. That could be a problem for you."

**Ellara's Spiritual Crisis:**
"I must pray on it."

"You can also help without being directly involved."

"How?"

"I don't know."

"I just need seventeen minutes."

**Divine Guidance:**
**Religion check: 21**

As Ellara meditated, the familiar sounds of the room faded away. Once again, she heard *that voice*—still not clearly, but the sentiment was unmistakable. It confirmed that helping these people was the right path, that many questions would find their answers in the lighthouse. However, the divine presence also warned her: it would not be easy.

When the sounds of the world returned, Ellara emerged from her meditation with new resolve.

**The Decision:**
She returned to the group and resolutely announced that she was in and needed to enter the lighthouse.

"It would be good to have you there," Nyx replied. "I just didn't want to force you."

"I appreciate that."
