## Session 5 – *Shadows in the Lighthouse*

**Season:** High Summer, Year 651 AE  
**Locales:** Streets & Bridges around the Duskbreaker Lighthouse · Two Bastion City taverns (unnamed guard bar & later pub) · West Bastion Residential Row (Artificer Residence) · Duskbreaker Lighthouse (Gate · Security Level · Recreation Wing · Storage · Warforged Vault · Guard Quarters · Research Floors · Director of Research Office · Director of Relations Door · Engineering (Floor 10) · Advanced Research Laboratory (Upper Spire) · High Arcana Floor (Wizard Scriptorium) · Summit Gallery) · Nyx's Townhouse

---

### 1 · The Plan Fractures Before It Forms

The afternoon opened with indecision pooling at the base of the Lighthouse like fog: remove Ysidor's armor for stealth? Attempt disguises? Waylay a shift? Forge passes? Stake out, then improvise? Every option felt half-measured. The party finally settled on staged reconnaissance: observe shift changes, trail likely targets, secure an entry vector.

*Table Talk to Tactics:* Even in this early huddle the group framed the coming act less as a heist and more as a moral edge test—though that edge had not yet drawn blood.

---

### 2 · First Shift: Guard Voices Off-Duty

**Luck Check:** 60 (neutral fortune)

Three leather‑armored guards with swords exited the Lighthouse for their off shift. **Berridin** melted into the crowd behind them (**Stealth 19**, unnoticed) and followed them into a bar.

**Eavesdropping (Perception 17):**
> "These night shifts so boring. Same thing every time—just monitoring the crystals."
> "Hey, they pay us well."
> "You did well with the poker game though?"

They were complacent—habit replacing vigilance. Poker, boredom, and routine crystal monitoring: a brittle security culture.

---

### 3 · Second Shift: Artificers Emerge

Evening deepened. Another trio emerged—this time *not* guards: belts jangling with varied potions, books, hammers and tools; more books strapped like mobile shelves. **Perception:** Ellara 7 / Nyx 10 (neither placed their roles immediately). They crossed a bridge; one peeled off alone while two aimed for a pub.

Ellara moved to shadow the solitary figure; Nyx refused to let her trail alone. As Nyx noted the pair entering a bar, the solitary artificer sensed she was not alone.

---

### 4 · Split Scenes: Bar, Pursuit, and Quiet Competence

Inside: Berridin observed the earlier guards drifting toward inebriation. He joined the act (Constitution save: **Nat 20**—unphased) and continued to listen (**Perception 16** with advantage). Two newcomers (the off‑duty artificers) entered; a visible ripple of annoyance passed through some soldiers.

Nyx slipped in afterwards (**Perception 8**—missed Berridin entirely), but later—ironically—caught intelligible technical chatter (**Perception Nat 20**) whose concepts were so far beyond him his follow‑up Intelligence check collapsed (**Intelligence 1**). Enough, however, to name them: artificers.

---

### 5 · Ellara and Darius: Polite Curiosity, Subtle Disdain

In a narrow turn of a quieter street the solitary artificer spun: "Why have you been following me, sister…?"

Ellara improvised—herbs, botanical inquiry, harmless interest. He reached out, sampling a proffered combination, instinctively recoiling at the rustic remedy.

**Persuasion 17:** She won a fragile professional courtesy. He scribbled an address and a future meeting time. Name: **Darius**.

> Darius (quiet aside, almost too soft for anyone *not* Ellara to register): a muted, habitual skepticism about Eulogians—respectful veneer over practical disdain. Ellara, earnest and luminous, missed the undercurrent entirely.

He introduced the craft plainly: *“I'm what you call an artificer—we take magic and technology and combine them.”* Yes, anyone *could* become one (years of training, of course). Herbs? "A bit old fashioned." Ellara countered with rural conviction: nature's latent potency. Truce by curiosity. 

Appointment set: A specific address later revealed to Ms. Faberge's workshop, the next evening.

---

### 6 · Berridin’s Guard Gambit: Social Engineering Over Steel

Back at the bar, Berridin leaned in with affected fatigue (**Persuasion 10**) to crack guard camaraderie.

Dialogue:
* Guard (teasing halfling stature): employment age jibe, apology.
* Berridin buys a round; guard loosens (mention of husband expecting him home—domestic stakes).
* Lighthouse hiring pipeline: mostly ex‑city guards, strict references, guarding 'secrets.'
* Daily routine: poker under the guise of alarm monitoring.
* Security emphasis: entry requires the *right pass*, not continuous scrutiny.

Opportunity surfaces. Guards depart, splitting. Berridin shadows the drunkest (**Stealth 16 vs Guard Nat 1, disadvantage for drunkenness**). Overconfident **Insight 4** births a plan: forge/fake a pass.

**Sleight of Hand Nat 20:** He lifts house keys and a runestone/metal contrivance (a security pass)—pristine success without detection. He later feels a pang of guilt and returns the keys.

---

### 7 · Nyx’s Shadow Turns Violent

Nyx pursued one of the departing artificers (**Stealth 16** to her **Perception 19**). She wheeled, weaponized gadget already discharging in a warning shot. His bluff fell flat (**Deception 6**). Escalation felt almost inevitable in the crackling air of suspicion.

Combat:
1. Nyx crossbow attack: 14 (miss).
2. Artificer counter: attack roll 14 (miss), then **Shocking Grasp** (6 lightning) after seizing his hand—reaction locked; she sprints 35 ft.
3. Nyx invokes **Blessing of the Raven Queen**, teleporting within 15 ft; her attempted Shield fizzles; his second attack hits (25) for 5 damage.
4. She casts **Sanctuary**, flees 35 ft screaming.
5. Nyx casts **Entangle**; she fails (4) and is restrained.
6. Nyx passes Sanctuary Wisdom save (21), strikes (21 to hit) for 4 damage.
7. She escapes Entangle (save 14), provokes—Nyx **Nat 20** opportunity attack for 12 damage; difficult terrain limits flight.
8. Nyx passes Sanctuary again (Wis 16), final shot to the head; she dies—eyes fixed toward the main causeway.

Loot & Aftermath: Potions (assorted), spellbook, toolkit, *runestone pass* (distinct sigil from guard’s), clothing—stripped for disguise. He hides the body, layers **Disguise Self** over the corpse, and stashes it (**Deception 18**). Internal monologue: anger—not pride. Body Count (grim emerging whisper in the city's rumor engine): 1. (Later identification: **Michelle Faberge, Director of Research**—a fact whose moral weight will not land on Ellara until the day unfolds.)

---

### 8 · Convergence: Uneasy Debrief

The party reconvenes; Nyx arrives disguised.

Nyx: obtained artifacts—but the source "is dead." Berridin tests: "Did you stumble onto her already dead?" Nyx neither fully denies nor glorifies, offering a muted history of past necessity.

Ysidor: *"Berridin… get away from the bad man."* Ellara, shocked into near-silence, stammers only a tremulous *“Wh-why?”*—her first brush with pragmatic killing in service of their mission.

Passes compared: guard runestone and artificer/director runestone—related sigil geometries, different clearance hierarchies.

Plan revision: dual infiltration—Berridin (as the *dead* Director) to ascend; Nyx (as guard) to map internal routines. Ellara & Ysidor to remain external / support; Tsi'Nyra for recon & contingency.

---

### 9 · Night Entry: Nyx Becomes “Stanley”

Nyx approaches. Atrium: open volume, hard Art Deco lines, cold competence. Two guards; all traffic flows rightward through rune‑locked portals—no plausible bypass.

Scan: *Beep* (accepted). Security gallery beyond: seated guards at inlaid panels of glowing runes. Empty chair—an unnoticed vacancy he fills.

Dialogue Snippets:
* "Oh Stanley, you're working tonight? Thought you were getting shitfaced."
* Complaints about recurring substance and gambling lapses: a portrait of the persona he must inhabit.
* Operating Doctrine: waiting for *alarms*—reactive security posture.

Observation: Every interior door requires runestone tap—potentially auditable token network.

---

### 10 · Dawn Hours: Director Ascends (Berridin as Faberge)

Early morning transition. Berridin scrubs blood, dons the artificer’s (Director’s) attire. Description (from Nyx’s earlier recounting): somewhat curly brown hair, 5’7", slim, bookish severity, spectacles—serious, unsmiling.

Entry: Guards greet with deferential routine. "Oh Ms. Faberge, early to the labs again." He delivers a wordless scowl of professional disdain: *"Always."* Scan passes.

Branch: Right descends; left ascends. He chooses ascent.

Floors 1–2: Benches, suspended light crystals, personalized contraptions—empty at this hour. **Investigation 5 / Intelligence 9:** Cannot decode apparatus.

Encounter: Nervous staffer—*“Didn't think you were in today—are you doing an inspection??”* 

**Intimidation 21:** Berridin weaponizes director authority: assigns urgency, extracts compliance.

At roughly Floor 15: Door labeled **“Michelle Faberge – Director of Research.”** He enters (scan accepted). Office: Desk, wall of scrolls & tomes, leaded lamp housing a light crystal, and a sealed adjoining door (to *Director of Relations: Donnathan Reeves*). Attempted cross‑scan: rejection chirp—hierarchical segmentation.

Inside: Incomplete runestone‑like devices with variant sigil matrices; one still warm—energetic residue. **Investigation Nat 1:** Initial comprehension failure. Follow‑up **Investigation 11:** Recognizes spectrum of developmental stages.

Subordinate (“Tingle”) arrives, stammering. Rapid‑fire report extracted:
* Transverse law + magical components causing rejection at threshold.
* Overpowering crystals at precise intervals could convert them into *long‑term power sources*.
* Phosphorus component raises capacity nearly tenfold.
* Applications: perpetual (24/7) warforged activation; municipal lamps requiring yearly (not weekly) recharge.
* Warforged Titan theoretical expansions.
* Files for Titan application: held by **Beth** in Engineering (Floor 10); not yet present; Director often uses an elevator alternative.
* Director of Relations **Donnathan Reeves** currently in Ordonne’s capital (Pharos) liaising with the Eulogians.

Dismissal delivered with surgical froideur; morale impact noted.

---

### 11 · Engineering to Ascendant Labs

Floor 10 (Engineering – Beth absent): Berridin pockets a *prototype* warm device (single‑use feel—arcane tension pre‑cast). He ascends higher: staff density thins while apparatus precision increases.

Upper Plateau: **Advanced Research Laboratory**—expansive vertical volume, glass and height merging into panoramic clarity. Deferential nods greet the disguised “Faberge.”

**Perception 16:**
* A Warforged four times larger than field units—panel access open; maintenance or iteration mid‑process.
* Additional upgraded warforged (smaller) in staged development—clean, modern, improved architecture over the antiquated trap‑site models.

Status Exchanges:
* Progress “on schedule” yet Berridin reframes “end of week ≠ schedule,” sustaining intimidating aura.
* Clipboard Technician Report (fully captured):
	- Alpha/Beta/Gamma test batteries: motor functions + command retention passed.
	- 24/7 operation concerns: command source vulnerability (theft / interference).
	- Exploring autonomous command designs—ethical + feasibility constraints (new tech, need for technically literate wizards).
	- Capture/refinement of command spells would stabilize deployment.
	- Field Test: current models (those the party fought) expected back; aggression commands set for *off‑road* (animals only) engagement.
	- Higher‑up authorization: test order traced above Director’s nominal chain (implication of layered governance); the "lightkeepers" are noted as being keenly interested in the results. the "lightkeepers" are noted as being keenly interested in the results.

He pushes further to the high *Arcana Floor*—a tonal shift: parchment, tomes, arcane scroll arrays. Wizard‑consultants, not subordinates.

Dialogue Fragment:
* Lex (specialist) absent; unresponsive even via magical messaging (“responds in the middle of sex” quip implies SENDING attempt returned glib acknowledgement; then silence). Appointment: Lex to report “tomorrow morning.”
* Index system for arcana volumes indicated; Berridin peruses (Perception 15) — curated magical library; **Arcana 8**: recognizes only the *weight* of potent single‑use magic, not function.
* Lex’s desk search **Perception 2**: abject failure amid chaos.

Summit: A panoramic overlook; only ducal palace rivals the Lighthouse’s vertical claim.

---

### 12 · Parallel Track: Ellara’s Morning, Unwitting Mourner

Ellara keeps her appointment with Darius at the scribbled West‑Edge address. He is surprised she *actually came*—hesitation infused with that subtle artificer cynicism toward Eulogians (again: she misses the shade; we do not).

He indicates a colleague’s personal lab—door locked, colleague conspicuously absent (“never late”). Status descriptors: *"technically higher up with a bad reputation but phenomenally intelligent."* Ellara only later realizes this missing mind is the very person Nyx killed.

They discuss a *water purification* side project for the neglected East Side—attempting perpetual spell enactment via mill‑like kinetic conversion. Darius: resource denial from official channels; crystals limited to single concurrency (one function or the other). Ellara suggests modular crystal layering; Darius withdraws—time pressure.

Future meet recommitted: The Wailing Pig, Tuesday evening.

Ellara performs *rituals for the dead* outside the locked residence—an act of reverent closure for a body she just realized is absent because of her own companion. Narrative irony sharpens: blessing the void left by the Director of Research.

Internal Response (later, upon learning identity): A conflict between doctrinal sanctity of life, loyalty to companions, and pragmatic infiltration necessity—no easy doctrinal verse offers absolution.

---

### 13 · Ysidor & Tsi'Nyra: Domestic Deterrence by Dissipation

Ambient sounds of domestic strife draw **Ysidor** & **Tsi’Nyra** toward the drunk guard’s residence (the one Berridin pick‑pocketed). Crashes; muffled argument. The guard reeks of alehouse despair.

Dialogue Excerpts:
* Ysidor (folksy maxim): “At rock bottom the best way up is by drinking—that’s what we say in my village.”
* Guard: Aron (husband) has *kicked him out* after a 24‑hour bender cycle; pattern of broken promises.
* Ysidor’s invented cultural therapy: public square airing & compensatory partner rotation (“the winner sleeps with someone else”)—alien, mildly scandalous; guard incredulous (“You want one of us to be cucks?” / “Goddess of love? Heresy—THE LIGHT.”)
* Drinking contest ensues: four shots each; guard collapses into blackout. Ysidor finishes remaining shots, pronounces a benevolent blessing: “May love guide you.”

Result: Guard incapacitated—prevented from reporting to shift (soft sabotage with unintended moral angles). This was the same guard Berridin had pickpocketed earlier.

---

### 14 · Nyx’s Patrol: Mapping the Inner Circuits

Called to patrol: “Stanley, your turn.”

He samples internal doors:
* Recreation: piano, plush leather, fireplace, unremarked passage; artificers ignore him.
* Med Bay: Attendant at a desk; notable gloves (deferred—too conspicuous to grab now).
* Heating: Intense heat blast—withdraw.
* Mess Hall: Active dining.
* Storage: Stones—**Sending Stones** in quantity. **Stealth 24 / Sleight of Hand 14:** Secures 5 unseen.
* Perception 16: Observes personnel writing with pens yet pages appear blank to him—invisible or sympathetic ink keyed to trained sight / augmented lenses.
* Warforged Vault: 10 deactivated warforged + 1 *massive* unit (distinct from 4x upper-spire construct). No obvious active sigils. **Insight 23:** Dormant state tied to *alarm triggers*; reactionary deployment model.

He resets loop, fabricates a pretext (“thought I heard a noise”), returns to station; guard banter underscores ennui: “So much fun isn’t it?”

Shift end: Clean extraction.

---

### 15 · High Arcana Cross-Thread: Lex and Ethical Autonomy

While Nyx patrols, Berridin’s presence upstairs elicits wizard consultant dynamics:
* Lex’s absence + message response cadence = possible external entanglement or compromised state.
* Ethical discourse (subtext from clipboard report and arcana floor murmurs): autonomy vs command-source theft risk; limited wizardly bandwidth; need for capturing command spells directly; moral hazard of self-directed constructs.

---

### 16 · Group Reconvergence & Moral Accounting

Nyx’s Townhouse becomes again an ad‑hoc operations center. Panther evidence (destroyed bed) remains. The mood is more brittle than after the Session 4 lunch.

Inventory & Intel Share (verbatim completeness retained):
* Confirmed: Duskbreaker Lighthouse manufactured the warforged encountered on the road; field test framing misaligned with actual aggression.
* Energetic Research: Phosphorus additive exponential capacity increase; path toward annual lamp recharge & continuous warforged activity.
* Warforged Titan concept & upgraded chassis lines.
* Autonomous command research vs centralized command stone vulnerability.
* Field Test recall pending—expectation of “only animals” engagement (false or naive assumption).
* Director of Relations (Donnathan Reeves) in Pharos (capital) engaging Eulogians—political vector.
* Wizard Specialist Lex: absent; to “see you tomorrow.”
* Engineering Contact: Beth (Floor 10) — source of Titan application files.
* Tools & Assets Acquired:
	- Guard runestone pass (Stanley’s).
	- Director of Research runestone (Michelle Faberge’s) + attire profile.
	- Prototype warm single‑use arcane device.
	- 5 Sending Stones.
	- Potions cache (from Faberge’s person).
	- Spellbook & toolkit (artificer).
	- House keys (guard’s residence).
* Observed Systems: invisible ink documentation; rune‑gated door hierarchy; dormant warforged vault & massive unit; upper-spire titan chassis (separate scale); multi-tier R&D culminating in wizard consultation layer.
* Side Project Lead: Water purification perpetual mechanism (Darius + absent colleague) – civic benevolence vs resource politics.
* Social & Security Weak Points: complacent poker culture; substance-dependent guard; interpersonal domestic strain; deference/fear culture around Director persona; cross‑department communication gaps (Beth absent; Lex absent).

Ellara’s Conflict: She pieces together (helped by Darius’s lament of a brilliant, missing higher-up) that the slain woman was **Michelle Faberge**. Shock curdles into conflicted reflection: the ritual she performed may have been the only memorial she *could* offer—yet would she have chosen differently had she known? Her faith frames the act as a tragic deviation; her companions frame it as collateral in pursuit of answers about Meri. The Light offers guidance but not absolution—tension unresolved.

Nyx: flat reporting—no bravado; emphasizes miscalculation leading to escalation rather than intent to kill. He rejects romanticizing the act.

Group Ethics Line (Current Draft): Avoid further lethal force if alternatives exist—but operational pressure (deep basement unknowns) may strain that vow.

---

### 17 · Threads & Tensions

| Thread / Question | Status / Findings (Session 5 Additions) |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Meri’s Whereabouts | Still missing; no evidence she left city; higher-level tests ordered “off-road” implies potential misdirection/field test misuse. |
| Warforged Program | Multi-tier development: upgraded chassis + titan-scale units; goal of 24/7 activation via phosphorus-boosted crystals; autonomy research vs command stone vulnerability; ethical debates ongoing. |
| Field Test Trap | Road encounter confirmed as Lighthouse constructs; staff narrative: intended to affect only animals (either lie or ignorance); impending diagnostic once units “return.” |
| Energy Research | Phosphorus additive expands capacity tenfold; potential civic (lamps) & militarized (continuous warforged) deployment. |
| Political Vector | Director of Relations Donnathan Reeves in Pharos liaising with Eulogians—tension front shifting to capital diplomacy. |
| Missing Personnel | Lex (wizard specialist) absent; Michelle Faberge (Director of Research) actually deceased (party-secret); Darius’s concern foreshadows internal shock when death is discovered. |
| Security Posture | Reliance on runestone passes; complacent guard culture; social engineering vulnerabilities; invisible/inaccessible documentation mediums (ink) gating internal knowledge. |
| Moral Fault Line | Nyx’s killing vs Ellara’s doctrines; emergent party code to minimize lethal outcomes going forward. |
| Assets Gained | Director + Guard passes, prototype arcane device, sending stones (x5), potions, spellbook, toolkit, keys, knowledge of layout & vertical research stratification. |
| Water Purification | Benevolent side project (Darius + Faberge) blocked by resource politics; potential leverage / goodwill avenue. |
| Autonomy Ethics | Internal resistance to fully autonomous warforged due to theft/interference risk and moral concerns; impetus for capturing command spells. |
| Basement Depths | Still uncharted—spider recon (Session 4) indicated deep, cold, insect-laden levels; Session 5 gained no new lower-level data. |
| Meri Lead Quality | Stagnant—need basement / records access or external political correspondence intercept (Reeves route). |

### 18 · Next Strategic Options

1. **Deep Descent:** Use Director pass to penetrate basement levels (risk: security cascade if Faberge’s absence noticed; time-sensitive before her nonappearance triggers alerts).
2. **Document Exploitation:** Acquire invisible ink deciphering method (spectacles? arcane filter? reagent) to harvest internal memos.
3. **Intercept Reeves:** Establish contact network in Pharos or shadow his return—political pressure vector.
4. **Leverage Darius:** Cultivate alliance via water purification research; moral high ground + intel ingress.
5. **Locate Lex:** Determine if absence is personal, coercive, or connected to Meri; potential arcane key to command-spell capture.
6. **Ethical Line Maintenance:** Formalize non-lethal incapacitation protocols (sleep agents, restraints) to preserve Ellara’s alignment and minimize internal fracture.

---

### 19 · Position at Session Close

The party holds unprecedented vertical intelligence and key passes—but also a blood secret that, if exposed, could collapse the social engineering scaffolding they now rely on. Meri remains a cipher. The Lighthouse hums toward a breakthrough—continuous, perhaps autonomous, constructs—while political outreach and civic neglect projects (like water purification) offer unexpected leverage points. Ellara’s conscience and Nyx’s pragmatism now share a narrow bridge—how they traverse it will color every future action beneath the crystal glow.

**Next:** Decide: immediate basement incursion before Director’s absence triggers suspicion, or consolidate alliances (Darius) and decode documentation to avoid blind descent.

---

*Body Count (Jack-the-Ripper of Bastion City):* 1 (Michelle Faberge).  
*Moral Equilibrium:* Unstable.  
*Operational Assets Secured:* High-value passes & comm stones.  
*Great Unseen Below:* Still waits.
