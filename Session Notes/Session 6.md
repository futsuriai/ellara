## Session 6 – *Runestone Escape*

**Season:** High Summer, Year 651 AE
**Locales:** Nyx's Townhouse · Michelle Faberge’s Workshop (Residential Street) · Duskbreaker Lighthouse (Guard Gallery · Vaulted Basement Lab · Med Bay) · East‑side Chapel · Old‑Growth Tree outside Bastion City

---

### 1 · Night Huddle at Nyx’s: Tools, Limits, Intent

*Security Posture (Nyx’s recap):* during rounds he *was* alone, but in the **guard rooms** there are **always multiple people**—no real windows of lower scrutiny. 

**Prototype rune check.** Berridin lays out the warm, half‑made device pulled from Faberge’s office. **Arcana:** Nyx **14**, Ellara **12**, Ysidor **1**—

* Ellara and Nyx sense shaped power but from an **arcane school foreign** to their usual idioms (divine/nature).
* Ysidor: “Yes, it’s a *stone*.” (Shakes it. “Does it know where **Meri** is?”) Berridin snatches it back.

**Sending stones test.** The group tests the five stones:

* Not telepathy—Berridin’s *“can you hear my thoughts?”* gets **no answer**.
* They behave like **small walkie‑talkies** needing **touch/intent** to transmit; they **won’t pick up** casual speech in a pocket unless someone speaks **loudly**.

**Plan sketch.** Try **one more day** as Director *Faberge* before people catch on. Nyx keeps the **guard persona**. Others stay mobile for diversion/extraction.

---

### 2 · Dawn Split: Nyx to the Gallery; Ellara to the Workshop

**Nyx** (as *Stanley*) checks in **downstairs** and takes the **same seat** in the guard gallery.

* Gallery banter snippets:

  * “He kicked you out?”
  * Nyx (flat): *“I don’t want to talk about it.”*
  * “Don’t drink so much? At least you don’t—” (trails off into routine gripes.)

**Ellara** walks the residential **workshop** Darius gave her. **Perception 17**: ordinary door, closed curtains, quiet street. Locked. She wild‑shapes into a **spider** and slips the **keyhole**.

* Inside: a workbench with **tomes**, components she can’t identify, and **handwritten notes**.
* The notes confirm Darius’s claims: the team is wrestling with **recharging while drawing power**, the same bottleneck hamstringing both **warforged** and **water purification**. **Insight (Nat 20)** links the constraints—one problem, one family of solutions.
* A marginal line lands like a blow: *“How much more blood will this cost.”*
* She carefully **copies diagrams and lines** into her notebook and pockets an **uncharged prototype spell‑rune** as reference.

### 3 · Berridin Descends: The Vaulted Lab & “The Subject”

**Performance 16** carries Berridin (in **Faberge’s** shape and attire) past checkpoints to the **main vault door**. He taps the runestone—**pause**—then **heavy mechanisms** turn and the portal opens onto a **cavernous lab** ringed with benches and a central well of activity.

He calls a **surprise inspection**. A lead artificer—**Dawn**—delivers an **oral report**:

* **Chain of custody:** the **Eulogians** “sent us this subject”; **Director of Relations Donnathan Reeves** handled the hand‑off “per protocol.”
* **The subject:** tall (7–8 ft), **grey‑skinned**, **ponytail**; currently **unconscious** at the center rig.
* **Work in progress:** **synthetic Light‑crystal** creation via processing of **shadowed** beings; synthetics are *more potent* and hold **stronger magics**.
* **Alive at initiation** is required, but the process **consumes** the subject.
* **Progress metric:** only **15%** after a day; **flora** have proven **easier than fauna**.
* **Next phase:** a **furnace‑like** high **heat/pressure** step to push conversion (diamond‑press analogy).

Berridin leans hard on authority (**Intimidation 24**) to keep questions flowing and eyes off paper trails. He orders a **pause** in sedation and a **transfer** to the **Med Bay** “for review.”

---

### 4 · Med Bay Setup: Clockwork Calm Before the Cut

The Med Bay team assumes Faberge’s authority without question:

* Tech: “By my calcs, sedation should wear off in **\~1 hour**.”
* Berridin: “Ensure **latest sedatives** are on hand; there’s **a new formula in the armory**.”
* Tech: “Of course, Ms. Faberge.”

Room cleared, Berridin tells the team on stone: **“Ysidor, ping me when you’re close to the front.”** He stands over **Meri**—breathing slow, restrained, but alive.

---

### 5 · Ellara’s Red Thread Tightens

Back in the workshop, Ellara uncovers a **second set of notes**: a sigil **matching** the geometry etched into Berridin’s **prototype rune**—

* Not a battery: a **scroll‑like trigger** for **emergency casting**—explicitly **Dimension Door**.
* When Berridin later calls for options, Ellara, cautious, says the device likely needs only **a push of magic** to **prime and fire**.

She hears **footsteps**—the door opens. **Darius** stumbles in, rattled: *“She wasn’t home… they said she was at the Lighthouse, impossible… I have to report this.”* He paces ten minutes and leaves to file the **missing‑person** report. Ellara slips out and warns the others that **official scrutiny is imminent**.

---

### 6 · Trigger: Dimension Door

Call‑and‑response over the stones: positions set. **Berridin** presses power into the **prototype**; a spell **coalesces** in his palm—intent snaps into place. He **grabs Meri**, pictures the **front doors**, and **steps**.

They **appear outside** the Lighthouse.

**Tsi’Nyra** sees them arrive. An immediate call hits the guard office: *“Ms. Faberge is missing.”* The **captain**, hearing Faberge’s voice elsewhere moments ago, **reprimands** the caller and orders a **full search**. Sirens/wards peel from the tower.

**On the cobbles:** Tsi’Nyra and her panther rush in. **Ysidor** barrels over the bridge (**Athletics 17**), clean‑lifts **Meri** onto his shoulder when the panther proves a clumsy stretcher. Berridin, still breathless, **drops the Faberge guise** for a **generic face** mid‑run.

---

### 7 · Breakout & Scatter: Alarms in the Rearview

**Tsi’Nyra (Survival 13)** takes point to **lead a route out of the city**.
**Nyx**, ordered to sweep the basement, uses the confusion (**Stealth 24**) to **slip out the front**, shedding the uniform for a random passerby look. On stones:

* Nyx: *“What’s been going on?”*
* Berridin (huffing): *“Running—guards alerted.”*
* Nyx: *“I’m already out. **Do not** go back to my place.”*
* Tsi’Nyra: *“Meet at the **old‑growth tree** outside the city.”*
* Nyx: *“The **mangled** tree.”*
* Tsi’Nyra: *“It’s **not** mangled, sir.”*

**Ellara** opts for lower profile, taking a **carriage** to the **east‑side chapel**, then cutting across country toward the **tree**.

---

### 8 · Under the Boughs: Triage & Reckoning

Night settles at the **old‑growth** landmark.

* **Medicine:** Ysidor **12**; Ellara **19**—Meri is **stable** and needs **rest**, not intervention.
* **Berridin’s report:** the Lighthouse is **turning shadowed beings into Light crystals**; **Meri** was on that track.
* **Ellara** balks: Light crystals come from **mines**, not people.
* **Nyx** demands **proof** beyond testimony and a panicked lab.
* **Berridin** cites the **oral report** (flora easier than fauna; staged furnace step; Reeves on the intake chain).
* **Tsi’Nyra**, staring into the branches, follows a painful logic: if **flora** were first, what does that mean for **her two missing siblings**?

---

### 9 · Open Threads & Take‑Aways

**Meri—Alive, Unsedated:** Now clear of the Lighthouse; next steps are **recovery** and **assessment** of memory/condition.

**Evidence Gap:** The party has **testimony** (Dawn’s report) and **workshop notes** (Dimension Door sigil; shared power bottleneck) but **no documents** about the shadow‑to‑crystal procedure; the **invisible‑ink** system still walls off records.

**Security Heat:** A tower‑wide **alarm** and an internal contradiction about Faberge’s whereabouts mean badges, faces, and **credibility** may burn fast.

**Darius’s Impending Report:** He’s going to file **Faberge missing**; that points investigators toward the **workshop**, potentially toward **Ellara’s intrusion**.

**Reeves Vector:** **Donnathan Reeves** is explicitly in the **chain of custody** for “subjects.” Political pressure or **intercepting correspondence** remains a live option.

**Prototype Runes:** One **charged** device expended to extract Meri; Ellara holds an **uncharged** sample and **copied sigils**. **Rechargeability** and **repeatability** unknown.

**Sending Stones, Confirmed Behavior:** Require **touch/intent**; low accidental transmission risk—useful for **quiet coordination**.

**Safehouse:** **Do not return** to Nyx’s townhouse. The group needs a **new base** until heat dies down.

**Personal Stakes:** Tsi’Nyra’s realization reframes urgency around her **missing siblings** (flora first successes).

---

**Position at Session Close:** **Meri** is with the party and **stable**. The Lighthouse is **alert** and will soon discover contradictions around **Faberge**. The team holds a spent prototype and fresh knowledge but lacks **paper proof**. Next moves hinge on Meri’s recovery and whether to press **paperwork** (ink/spectacles), **politics** (Reeves), or **people** (Tsi’Nyra’s family) before the Lighthouse regroups.
