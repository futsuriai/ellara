# Session 6 — *Descent into Darkness*

## 1) Evening at Nyx’s — The Plan, the Tools, the Limits

They re-ran last session’s intel. Nyx: patrols could be solo, but **guard rooms were always staffed**—no natural “quiet corner” to slip through. He’d seen **stored warforged**, **invisible ink**, and pocketed **five sending stones**; he hadn’t gotten into the main room. Recap included that **Lex**—a wizard contractor—was working with **Michelle** on **long-term power** for warforged, and that the Lighthouse’s ruling council are the **Lightkeepers**. He and Berridin both weren’t sure *why* the new warforged were being developed (**History/Insight 10/10**), only that the **modern units** weren’t yet able to run independently for long.

Berridin argued for **one more day** before the Lighthouse realized Michelle was missing: he’d go back **as Faberge**, aiming for the **basement**; Nyx would clock in as **Stanley** again. They inspected Berridin’s **experimental runestone**—Nyx **Arcana 14**, Ellara **12**, Ysidor **1**—no clear read; “Yes, it’s a *stone*,” Ysidor said, shaking it and asking if it knew where Meri was. They **tested the sending stones**: **press-to-talk** activation; normal conversation doesn’t carry unless you speak up; Ellara even tested pocket-level mumbling—no pickup. Others would **watch the exterior** for trouble.

## 2) Morning Split — Nyx to Security, Ellara to Workshop, Berridin to the Vault Door

**Nyx** slid into the guard desk. The usual ribbing—“He kicked you out?” “Don’t drink so much.”—and business as usual. No shift in coverage: **multiple guards in guard rooms at all times**.

**Ellara** found **Faberge’s workshop** off a main street—ordinary door, curtains drawn (**Perception 17**). After checking the lane, she **wild-shaped into a spider** and slipped the keyhole—*a power she’s ashamed of and avoids using where anyone might see.* Inside: a workbench of components she couldn’t place, tomes, and tight notes. She pieced together the **shared bottleneck**: warforged long-term power and east-side water purification both fail when trying to **draw power while spending it**. One line hit like a curse: *“How much more blood will this cost.”* (**Insight Nat 20**).

**Berridin**, **Performance 16**, rode Faberge’s pass to a **vault door**. Mechanisms churned; it opened into a **cavern lab**—rings of benches around a central rig. “Dr. Faberge, we didn’t expect you today.” “**Surprise inspection.** Oral report,” he said. He looked down into the rig and froze: **Meri**, tall, grey-skinned, hair bound, **unconscious** and **shackled**. He pressed the lead tech—**Dawn**—hard (**Intimidation 24**).

---

## 3) The Chamber with Meri — The Full Download

Under Berridin’s questioning, **Dawn** laid out the whole thing:

* **Source & chain of custody.** “**Eulogians sent us this subject.** As usual, **Donnathan Reeves** handled the hand-off *per protocol*. Anything he brings is in your custody, direct or not.” Once a run finishes, **processed crystals go upstairs** to current projects. Before this, they worked with **found crystals** from **Shadowed ruins**, which were hard to purify due to **cross-contamination**—hence the push to **synthesis**.
* **Method & ethics.** “As you know, **light crystals are forged from Shadowed ones**.” **Alive at initiation** produces the best results; the process **consumes the subject**. The **synthetic** crystals they’re making are **more powerful** and **hold more** magic.
* **Status of this subject (Meri).** After roughly a day, they were only at **15%**; **Shadowed flora** have been **easier** than **fauna**; for today they planned the **furnace**—**high heat/pressure**, like synthetic diamond presses—to destabilize the form. Meri was **still alive**. Historically they’d kept such subjects **heavily sedated**; how sedation affects outcomes was **TBD**. This one was **“violent.”**
* **Prior “successes.”** Two **floral bio-specimens** used previously—**somewhat humanoid**—which Dawn admitted Berridin-as-Faberge hadn’t been “fully for,” but “all in the name of the Lighthouse.”

Berridin **froze the run** “from higher-ups,” ordered **sedation stopped** and **Meri moved to Med Bay**; staff balked about risk/violence. He asked for **upgraded shackles**, tried to pick the **worst** ones (**Perception 2**, no clue), and forced compliance. A sweep (**Perception 13 / Investigation 8**) couldn’t make sense of the sprawling machinery beyond confirming the **incubator**, **piping**, and **logs** detailing the failed progress on *this* subject. He confirmed **disposal procedure**: once processed, crystals go **upstairs**.

---

## 4) Nyx in the Middle — The Move to Med Bay

The movement order hit the comms. “**Stanley, Cooper—move the specimen.**” Nyx rode the stretcher with “Faberge” and artificers. He saw **no sign of the gloves** he’d clocked the day prior. Instruction relayed: **cease sedation**, **keep shackles on**. “Great, no sedation—this’ll go well,” the attending tech muttered, rolling eyes as Nyx left. He checked back in: “Faberge, it’s done.”

---

## 5) Ysidor’s Hour — Home, Bar, and Atonement

**Stanley’s door.** **Aaron** answered; braced for a collector. Ysidor talked it down: not here for debts. If Stanley begged on his knees and swore off drink, would Aaron give him **one more chance**? A brittle maybe.

**The bar.** Stanley, glass in hand, sunk.
“What if I told you I can get your marriage back **within the hour**?”
“Are you **coming on to me**?”
“No. That would be inappropriate. You are married.”
“What kind of Eulogian are you?”
“The kind who **helps**,” Ysidor said—and began the **Atonement** rite. (**Insight 21**.) Breath by breath the words took, a steady pressure on a door swollen with rain. Stanley **stood**: “No… I shouldn’t drink. Maybe you’re right.” He **ran** for home. Ysidor smiled after him, then the stone buzzed.

> “**Berridin?**”
>
> “Touch the stoneeee.”
>
> “Are you **in** here? Is it *small* in there, or sized for you?”
>
> “…It’s **roomy**.”
>
> “**Meri?** You found her? Do I break the front door?”
>
> “**No.** Wait for my signal.”
>
> “I fixed the guard’s marriage.”
>
> “Amazing. Nice job.”

## 6) Ellara’s Second Pass — The Rune and the Threat

Back in the workshop, **Investigation Nat 20** paid off. A **second set of notes**: the **same sigil** as Berridin’s prototype—**single-use spell-matrix**, *cast like a scroll in emergencies*—explicitly a **Dimension Door** trigger. Ellara sketched everything and pocketed an **uncharged** duplicate. When she reported this to the team, she could explain the trigger but **(INT 5)** couldn’t form a full extraction plan beyond using the rune’s burst.

After some time, a **key** scraped the lock: **Darius**, rattled. “She wasn’t home—**they said she was at the Lighthouse**—that’s impossible—I have to **report** this.” He spiraled for nearly ten minutes and bolted. Ellara changed back and warned the group: someone was on the way to **report Faberge missing**.

---

## 7) Med Bay — The Door in the Light

Berridin walked into **Med Bay**. The attendant noted sedatives on hand; by their calculations, sedation would **wear off in about an hour**. Berridin sent them to fetch a **“new formula”** from the armory—**alone** with Meri at last. Over the stone: “Tell me when you’re **close enough** to run in front of the Lighthouse.” He **fed magic** into the prototype, **touched Meri**, pictured the **front steps**—and **blinked** them into daylight. **Tsi’Nyra** saw them pop into existence. Inside, a crackling call: “**Ms. Faberge is missing—**” “She’s **right there**, idiot.” “**Search the premises!**” **Alarm** sirens spilled into the streets.

---

## 8) The Great Escape — Cross-Cut, Breathless

* **Tsi’Nyra** swung up on the panther, tried to get Meri across the saddle—too heavy.
* **Ysidor** thundered over the bridge (**Athletics 17**), **hauled** Meri onto his shoulder, and **ran** in lockstep with the panther. **Tsi’Nyra** scouted the alleys and roofs (**Survival 13**).
* **Berridin** dropped Faberge’s face for a **nondescript** human mid-flight.
* **Nyx**, ordered to check the **basement**, used the panic to **ghost** out the front (**Stealth 24**), masked as a random passerby. “I’m already out. **Do not** go back to my place.”
* **Stones, overlapping:**
  
  “What’s going on?” —Nyx

  “We’re **running**. Guards are alerted.” —Berridin

  “Where do we meet?” —Nyx

  “**Outside the cityyyy**,” Tsi’Nyra sang from the rooftops.

  “That’s… **huge**.” —Nyx

  “There’s an **old growth tree**.” —Tsi’Nyra

  “We meet at the **mangled** tree.” —Nyx

  “It’s **not mangled**, sir.” —Tsi’Nyra
* **Ellara**, unhurried, took a **carriage** to the eastern chapel and walked from there.

## 9) Night Under the Old Growth — Medicine, Faith, and Fallout

Beneath gnarled branches, **Meri** breathed slow; **Ysidor Medicine 12** worried; **Ellara Medicine 19** diagnosed: *she needs **rest**, nothing more.* She said it out loud for Ysidor’s sake.

Berridin recounted the chamber plainly: the Lighthouse is **synthesizing** light crystals by **consuming Shadowed beings**—**flora first (two)**, now **fauna (Meri)**—and got only **15%** in a day; next was **furnace** heat/pressure. **Processed crystals** go **upstairs**; **found crystals** from **Shadowed ruins** are hard to purify due to **cross-contamination**; **Eulogians**, via **Donnathan Reeves**, are the **ones delivering subjects** “per protocol.”

Ellara **rejected** it: “That can’t be. Light crystals come from **mines**.”
Nyx asked for **proof**. Berridin said **the artificers told him**—and that **mines often sit on Shadowed ruins**, which gave the first precedent.

The worst part hit in silence. **Two floral** subjects—*somewhat humanoid.* Tsi’Nyra, who alone could read what that meant for *flora* like her, did the math to realize it was her sisters and **said nothing**. Nyx’s **Insight Nat 20** saw something break across her face and—mercifully—let it be.

Berridin told **Ellara** the other blow: **Eulogians**, through **Donnathan Reeves**, had **handed Meri over**.

“That **can’t** be. **Proctor Eduard** wouldn’t lie to me.”

“Maybe not with his **hands**,” Ysidor said softly, “but he **allowed** it.”

“This was **not** the work of Eulogia,” Ellara insisted.

Nyx laid a hand on her shoulder in kindness. **She stepped away immediately without a word.**

Berridin’s only comfort for **Ysidor**: “They only got **15%**. She was **fighting** the entire time.”

“Of course she was,” he said, eyes wet. “That’s **who she is**.”

| **Meri**               | **Rescued.** Unconscious but **stable**; with the party outside the city. Needs **rest**. (Ellara **Med 19**.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Names & Chains**     | **Dawn** (lead tech) named **Donnathan Reeves** as the **Eulogian liaison** who **hands over** subjects “per protocol.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Faberge’s Workshop** | Shared **power bottleneck** (warforged & water). Ethical note: *“How much more blood will this cost.”* **Dimension Door** **single-use** rune identified; Ellara took **detailed notes** and an **uncharged** spare.

## Next Steps

* **Stabilize Meri** and plan watch rotations while she rests.
* **Corroborate** Dawn’s testimony: **logs**, **custody records** (Reeves), and **upstairs** crystal allocations.
* Decide on **Eduard**: gather proof first or confront now—and how to do either without tipping the Lighthouse.

*End: starry sky, old bark, and a friend rescued at 15%—living proof the machine isn’t perfect... yet*
