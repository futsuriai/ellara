## 1) Night Flight — The Tree, the Road, the Barn

They didn’t linger under the gnarled tree. Nyx tried to read the dark, but the adrenaline still roaring through him made the night a smear (**Survival 7**). “We need cover,” he hissed. Ellara knelt and gently forced a goodberry past Meri’s lips—“Swallow”—and the color rose a shade in the Shadowed woman’s cheeks. Somewhere back toward the city, Ysidor heard raised voices and the thud of feet (**Perception 17**). “North,” he said quietly. “Old barn. An hour. We move.”

On the march, Ellara tried to throw off pursuit, scuffing sign and breaking patterns, but the ground took her poorly (**Survival 9**). The barn, when it loomed up, was a hollow ribcage: gapped boards, rotten hay, the dry whisper of small things nesting. Inside, Nyx asked if they should do something more for Meri; Ysidor knelt, rested a steady hand, and let a trickle of divine warmth flow—**Lay on Hands**, “just in case.” Ellara circled out, whispering to a covertly summoned owl to keep a lazy, vigilant ring over the field. Nyx took a turn in the yard, but his nerves made a poor scout (**Perception 6**).

They made what peace they could. In the quiet, the party’s inner weather shifted: Ellara’s relief at the rescue jostled against the shock of Eulogian complicity and the grim fact of a killing; Ysidor’s joy at finding Meri alive soured with the thought that *the village elders had been right about the city*; Berridin, shaken, turned the spent rune in his hands (**Arcana 10**): a thing built to do something, now dormant, waiting; and Nyx—who had never had companions *react* this way to what needed doing—felt the weight of the night’s choice settle where sleep should be. They slept. The owl reported nothing. Before dawn Ellara prayed; Ysidor and Nyx rose out of habit; Berridin snored on.

## 2) Dawn in the Barn — “Little Hill”

Meri’s lilac eyes opened to Ysidor’s blurred silhouette.

**Meri:** (Smiling faintly) "Little Hill. I didn’t think I’d see you again."

That undid him; Ysidor just started crying, the sobs eventually growing loud enough to wake Berridin.

**Meri:** (Teasing gently) "You were always such a crybaby."
**Ysidor:** (Laughing through a sob) "I was so worried. You were there but you weren’t there… I’m just so happy that you’re alive."
**Meri:** "It’ll take more than that for those city folk to get rid of me."

As Ysidor made introductions, Meri took their measure. He described Nyx as “a scary dude from the city,” Ellara as “a very sweet person,” Berridin as “a child left to his own devices,” and whispered about Tsi’Nyra, “I don’t know if she’s human or not, but she has a nice cat.”

**Meri:** "Nice to meet you all. Hopefully he hasn’t made much trouble for you. I assume you got me out of that forsaken contraption."

They confirmed they had. When Ellara offered food and care, Meri found she wasn’t as hungry as she ought to be.

**Ellara:** "Do you wish to go back to your village? Or perhaps file a formal complaint with the Duke?"
**Meri:** "The Duke won’t do anything for us. We’re Shadowed… Little hill, they will continue with that. They do not care what we want. No one in the city will help."
**Ysidor:** "What *did* lead you to come to the city?"
**Meri:** "They want to start a mine in our part of the mountain to find their light crystals. They were going to cut our own access and force our people to mine. The Eulogians tried to *smooth things over*."
**Ellara:** (Voice strained) "What does ‘smooth things over’ mean?"
**Meri:** "They want to bring the Light of Eulogia and the Empire to our people. I tried to petition and was arrested on sight. Then I was in jail, then a Eulogian priest came, then… I was attached to the machine."

When Ellara asked in a scared voice what the priest looked like, Meri’s description drew the unmistakable shape of **Proctor Eduard**.

**Ellara:** "I just don’t understand. I can’t believe he would do this."
**Meri:** (Sighing, weary) "What do you mean? That’s what Eulogians do to us Shadowed."
**Ellara:** "That’s not what doctrine teaches! That’s not what we do!"

Meri let the argument drop, turning back to Ysidor. “Little hill, I’ve been gone too long. Our folk are sturdy, but they still need our help.”

## 3) The Crossroads — Village, Lighthouse, or Both

Ysidor’s shoulders squared. “Then I need to go back. My duty is to our people first.” Ellara’s conviction was just as sharp. “I have to confront Proctor Eduard. We can’t let them keep dragging innocents into that experiment.” Her mind, however, raced and stalled, failing to form a compelling argument on the spot (**Intelligence Nat 1**).

The debate that followed drew a line through the heart of the party.

**Meri:** "I will always let Little Hill follow his heart, but my duty is to **Hyrta**."
**Nyx:** "…or we follow you to your village and the threat will always remain."

He thought back on his work in Bastion (**Insight 21**): how he'd worked for the elite, how they didn't care *how* a job got done, just *that* it was. They paid people like him to get what they wanted, and he knew there was a high likelihood he'd be hired to find Meri if he just went back. He laid his cards on the table.

**Nyx:** "Honestly, if I go back to the city and do nothing, there is a high likelihood that the elite will ask me to go collect you. I’m in a position where I don’t think I can do that… I wouldn’t want to. So I think I will go with Ellara to see if we can stop this."
**Berridin:** (Bowing with a flourish) "Madam, I am the one you gripped you tight and pulled you from perdition. I am your knight in shining armor. I rescued you, and I’d love to offer my assistance in procuring your home."
**Meri:** (Face turning to Ysidor like—*is this guy for real?*) "Rambunctious, are you? I would gladly take your assistance."
**Nyx:** "If we do split up, we do have sending stones. We can stay in touch."
**Meri:** "The marvels of city technology… but it’s a long travel."

The practicalities gave way to raw, clashing principles.

**Ellara:** (Angrily) "Master Ysidor, you saw what they were doing! You can’t buy your family’s safety with the lives of innocents."
**Meri:** "Oh, youth, to be hopeful. By what power do you hold, child, that you can turn the tides? Little Hill has the freedom to choose as his heart does."
**Ellara:** "If he wants to save his village, he has to stop what is happening here! You may not follow the Light of Eulogia, but you are on the same path in your own way."
**Meri:** "I did not see them, but you did not suffer having your life force drained from you. Everything becomes paler. Do not tell me what I do not know. You are not Shadowed; you don’t know the cruelty of your city. The Light is **too blinding**. Don’t try to educate me on what can be changed that has not in centuries."
**Ellara:** (Crying) "I don’t know what happened centuries ago, but I know what we saw! And if they finish that research, no village will be safe!"

Nyx pushed back his hood, revealing his own Shadowed features.

**Nyx:** "They experimented on you to see if you could be turned into a light crystal. Just to see if they could use Shadowed like **us** as a common energy source. They will find others. I don’t want to be a **light bulb**."
**Meri:** (Nodding once) "I do not begrudge your path. Do not begrudge mine."

Berridin laid his hand on Ysidor. “Ysidor, I understand your trepidation, but I think our new friend needs you.” Ysidor took a deep breath, his path forward clarifying.

**Ysidor:** "I understand my duty to the village, but I know Hyr would not want me to abandon those in need when they are in front of me. I will go to the village—**in a month's time**. After I have resolved the situation here."

He pressed a **sending stone** into Meri’s palm. "I hear these things have a mini version of you or us inside to talk. I will make my way immediately if needed."

**Meri:** "My sweet, sweet Little Hill. Follow Hyr. I know you hear her as well as I do." (She looks at Berridin) "Halfling, are you still accompanying me?"
**Berridin:** (Shouldering his pack) "It's ok, I've been known to carry larger women."

Before he could take a step, Ysidor hoisted him potato-sack style.

**Ysidor:** "Young one, it’s too dangerous. You can come with me when I go in a month. Right now the road is no place for a child to be on their own."
**Meri:** (To Nyx, as Berridin thrashes) "You do realize your friend is not a child?"
**Nyx:** (Sighing) "We tried."
**Meri:** "Little Hill never changes. Good heart. A little stubborn like stone. Just watch out for him, he’s a little gullible. He thought a mountain lion was a pet."

Farewells were simple and warm. Berridin screamed out “**Remember me!**” and blew a kiss that Meri snatched from the air without looking. Ellara apologized for her outburst.

**Meri:** "I know the light is bright and we don’t see eye to eye. It may be heresy to you, but even Hyr can be found in the Light. I know youth and concern is what drove you. Do not let your faith blind you. If you stare too long at light, it will blind you... Little one," (she glances at Berridin) "if you do make it to the village, I can show you the true meaning of Hyr."

She promised to speak to Ysidor in two months' time, then turned down the road.

## 4) Back Toward Bastion — Hedge the Risk, Keep the Appointment

The remaining party turned back toward the city.

**Ellara:** "Now, we should head back and confront Proctor Eduard."
**Ysidor:** "That works."
**Nyx:** "I can find things out discreetly, but I won't be able to be the face of interactions. I’m here to support. Well Ellara, we’re here to help. What do you want to do?"
**Ellara:** "I literally just said we need to talk to Proctor Eduard."
**Nyx:** "All of us?"
**Ellara:** "Yes."
**Berridin:** "We need to observe how the Lighthouse responds to Meri’s disappearance."
**Nyx:** "Maybe… but if he is implicated, and I know you don’t like this, he won’t let us leave. That’s a risk. We still need to split up and hedge our risk."
**Ysidor:** (Touching the warpick at his side) "I’d like to speak to this Proctor, this Eduard."
**Ellara:** (To Berridin) "If I remember correctly, Donnathan was in charge of liaising with the Eulogia. That’s just another point for talking to the Proctor."
**Berridin:** "You know you’re my first love, but your mentor has hurt my second love. We might need to bring back Moose; we should be careful about showing a Goliath through the city."
**Ellara:** "I don't know what to make of that."

## 5) Gate, Watch, Seminary — And a Name with a Face

Something had changed at the **East Gate**. A **new-model warforged** stood **inactive** just outside; another waited just inside. The owl familiar noted that people still mostly **walked through**, looking confused, but there was no obvious checkpoint or questioning. Back on the east side by **late morning**, Ellara peeled for the seminary to set a meeting. Outside the **Lighthouse** she clocked **two active modern warforged** and sent word over the stone. She arrived at the seminary around **lunch**, toward the end of the meal service. In the mess hall, she grabbed food and sat near Proctor Eduard, who was talking with someone. He spotted her.

“Acolyte Ellara,” he called, voice genial and proprietorial, “come here, come here! I didn’t see you at morning mass. I want to introduce you to someone.” A lanky man with the intentionality of bed-hair and a well-tailored suit turned with him. “This is **Donnathan Reeves**,” Eduard said—“**Director of Relations** at the Lighthouse.” Ellara smiled and set her tray down. End scene.

## Where We Stand

| **Thread** | **Status & Evidence** |
| --- | --- |
| **Meri** | **Alive and free**, heading for Hyrta; warns “the **engines of the Empire** aren’t slowing.” Has Ysidor's **sending stone**. |
| **Berridin** | Tragically not accompanying Meri to **Hyrta**. |
| **Ysidor’s Clock** | Staying **one month** to help address the Lighthouse, then returns home. |
| **Team Plan** | **Ellara** to seek a **meeting with Proctor Eduard**; **Nyx** insists on **hedging** roles/egress; **Berridin** to **observe** Lighthouse reaction from a distance. |
| **Security Posture** | East Gate: **newer warforged** posted outside/inside, both **inactive**. Lighthouse exterior: **two active modern warforged** on watch. |
| **Political Vector** | **Eduard** personally introduces **Donnathan Reeves (Director of Relations)** to Ellara—putting the named liaison directly in the party’s orbit. |
| **Fault Line (Faith/Lived Harm)** | Ellara’s doctrine vs Meri’s experience (“the **Light is too blinding**”); **Nyx** declares himself Shadowed and refuses to be anyone’s **“light bulb.”** |
| **Tools & Limits** | **Sending stones** keep comms alive; Ellara’s **owl** for recon; Berridin’s **Dimension Door rune** is **dormant**. |

### Next Steps

1.  **Stage the Eduard meeting** (Ellara leads) while assigning roles and exit vectors.
2.  **Shadow/engage Reeves** as needed; probe his role in the chain-of-custody without tipping the party's hand.
3.  **Monitor security posture** changes at the Gate/Lighthouse for signs they're reacting to Meri’s “disappearance.”
