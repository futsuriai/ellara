## 1) Courtesies & Titles — Ellara, Proctor Eduard, and Director Reeves

Ellara found herself ushered into the orbit of power: **Proctor Eduard** was finishing lunch with **Director Donnathan Reeves**.

**Reeves:** “Oh, it’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you?”  
**Ellara:** “I met **Proctor Eduard**’s… friend in Pharos—**Empress Consort Lyssandra**. I serve, in a manner of speaking, as **public relations** for the Duskbreaker—liaison among the Imperial family, nobility, and Eulogians.”  

Ellara’s memory leapt to the fore (**History Nat 20**): **Eduard** is the **fifth son** of a noble line—**the former Marchioness of Marchenbau** (Boixden Province). His eldest brother inherited; a grand‑niece married the Emperor, becoming the **Empress Consort**. The math has always been there; Ellara had simply never needed to say it out loud.

**Reeves:** “Torchlight College—where I met His Grace, the Grand Duke. My family tends vines in **Sommeil**. My brother is the **Count**; I’m merely a **viscount**, and I dislike the title.”  
**Eduard:** “Director Reeves—no, **Viscount Donnathan**.”  
**Reeves:** (Wincing) “Outside court, please. ‘**Lord Sommeil**’ if you *must.* Titles are useless among common folk.”

Ellara bowed awkwardly. The moment passed with quiet humor. When Reeves excused himself—“I haven’t seen **Valerian** in a while; I should pay my respects”—Ellara caught the Proctor’s unreadable pinch at the use of the Grand Duke’s given name (**Insight 12**).

## 2) The Office of Light — Trust, Doubt, and Doctrine

Eduard led Ellara to his **paper‑strewn office**—neat shelving, and a **light‑crystal lamp** glowing steadily.

**Ellara:** “Were you able to speak with Director Reeves about the **goliath** situation?”  
**Eduard:** “Yes. He’ll **look into it**. He’s just back and bound for the ducal palace a few days—as he is wont to do. These things take time.”  
**Ellara:** “Forgive me—I worried you were not who you seemed.”  
**Eduard:** “I don’t make my **birth** public, but I am the **Proctor** now. Questioning is part of the Light. As for the **Denmother**—we all have our indulgences.”  
**Ellara:** “The path of the Light is not easy, but it is **straightforward**.”  
**Eduard:** “It’s **harder** if you’re not born into court. They were *born* to it.”  
**Ellara:** “Perhaps that’s why the path feels easy to me. I’ve met those **not born** into it; my words don’t always reach them.”  
**Eduard:** “We can **light** a room—they must **choose** to step in. Continue as you are. As for Reeves… he is a man **bound by ambition** and by his **own loyalties**. I trust him—to always act as **he** will.”

Ellara left with a blessing…and a knot.

## 3) Stones Across the City — Check‑ins and Friction

At **Nyx’s** apartment, **Berridin** napped fitfully, dreaming of **Meri**. Nyx palmed a **sending stone**.

> **Nyx:** “Checking in. Done with Eduard?”  
> **Ellara:** “Yes. He is who he says he is. We can trust him—within… limits. He spoke with **Reeves**; it may take **time**.”  
> **Nyx:** “You safe?”  
> **Ellara:** “The **Seminary** is safe.”

Berridin’s mutter—“Did she realize her mentor is **crazy**?”—landed badly. Ellara curtly ended the thread. Moments later he apologized (**Persuasion 21**); she accepted—with a sigh.

Talk turned tactical: tail **Reeves** at the **ducal palace**? **Nyx** cut the air with a gesture. “We need information. Not **assassinations**.”

## 4) The Lamp that Screamed — Vision, Temptation, and a Test

That night Ellara prayed (**Religion 18**). **Calm** came without answers—until sleep brought **voices in agony** and the image of a **light‑crystal lamp** **screaming** on a desk—the lamp from **Eduard’s** office.

Morning. She tried his door; it opened. Ellara reached for the lamp (**Sleight of Hand 8**, then **Guidance +3**), stopping before she cracked the mount.

**Eduard:** “Oh, Ellara.”  
**Ellara:** “I had a **vision** about your lamp. May I… borrow it?”  
**Eduard:** “Sometimes the **Light** sends messages. Sometimes they mirror our **anxieties**. You may borrow it—but this is the **wrong** way to pursue meaning.”  

Back in her cell: **Investigation 16**, **Arcana 16**—it was a **normal light crystal**. The **scream** wasn’t inside *this* lamp at all; it was the **pain** all crystals are **made** from.

## 5) Masks On — The Return to the Lighthouse

They met at Nyx’s. **Disguises** were chosen:

- **Nyx**: long dark **Aragorn‑like** hair, alias **“Noctis.”**  
- **Berridin**: six‑foot, ebony‑skinned **Kal’din Veilspire**, scarred and gruff.  
- **Ysidor**: the ever‑deadpan **“Moose.”**  

**Noctis:** “We have **rune passes**—but using them will likely **trip logging**. And **she**—the guard—has been **missing**.”

At the **forecourt**, **Moose** pitched a pebble at a **warforged**. It boomed against the chassis—then a second rock, harder. The sentinel **unfolded** from five to **eight feet**, eyes **lighting**. A guard burst from the door.  

**Moose:** (Pointing at the construct) “**He** started it.” (**Deception Dirty 20**)

The guard groaned, slapped a rune, powered it **down**, and went back inside.

“Again,” Berridin said. “Nyx—**slip** in when they come out.”  
**Word of Radiance** flared from Ysidor; the constructs **saved**. The **alarm** in the guard captain’s **eyes** did not. He charged.

## 6) Bullet‑Time — The Scramble at the Gate

- **Captain dashes**; pulls up on **Moose**.  
- **Berridin** feigns panic, tries to **shove** the construct; it stares and turns to him. He *over‑acts* (**Performance bonus action: Nat 1**). The captain grows **suspicious**.  
- A second **guard** arrives.  
- **Nyx** ghosts toward the doors (**Stealth 16**), uses his **pass**—**alarms** blare. He sells it (poorly, **Deception 5**).  
- **Warforged A** smashes Berridin (**14 to hit → 13 damage**).  
- **Warforged A** swings at Ysidor (**18 → 4 damage**).  
- **Ysidor** **grabs Berridin** and **bolts**—eats a storm of **opportunity attacks** (10/13/16/8—**all miss**). He **Lay on Hands** Berridin for **13**, then throws up **Shield of Faith** (+2 AC).  
- Guard **slashes** Ysidor (**Nat 20 → 17**, **Stone’s Endurance** blunts to **13**).  
- **Berridin** throws a **Minor Illusion** **wall**, then later an **illusory Nyx**; he also **Inspires** both friends.  
- **Nyx** stabs a guard (**18 to hit → 5**), then **dashes**.  
- **Warforged B** hurls a **javelin** (**20 → 19**, shattering a **Mirror Image**; a second throw **24**, the duplicate takes it).  
- **Ysidor** **parkours** a wall and is **gone**.  
- **Nyx** teleports with **Blessing of the Raven Queen** to a **roof**, then **hides** (**Stealth 19**).  

The street fills with **boots and brass**. Then—silence. The three have **slipped** the noose.

## 7) Badwater and Boundaries — The Aftermath on the Stones

**Nyx** pinged the stones: “I’m good. You?”  
**Berridin:** “We’re freaking out. Where?”  
**Nyx:** “Don’t pick an obvious landmark. **Badwater Well**—**one day**.”  

He cut a separate line to **Ellara**: “Now is **not** a good time. Give us **two days**. Keep your **stone** on. And don’t go near the **Lighthouse**.”

**Ellara:** “Did something **happen**?”  
**Nyx:** “Everything is **fine**. Keep your stone on.” (The tone said otherwise.)

Ellara sought **Berridin**: was the group alright? He dodged with a joke about a **bet**. Ellara’s eyes narrowed (**Insight 21 vs Deception 18**).

**Ellara:** “If you truly seek the **Light**, the first step is **honesty**. I will speak to you **tomorrow**.”

## 8) Threads, Tensions, and Next Steps

**Resolved / Advanced**  
- **Proctor Eduard’s origins & ties**: nobility of **Marchenbau**; personal connection to the Imperial family; *presently* sincere in doctrine, but pragmatic about court.  
- **Reeves’ status**: confirmed **Viscount**; splitting time between Bastion & the **Ducal Palace**; ambition acknowledged by Eduard.  
- **Ellara’s Lamp Vision**: not a cursed object; a **moral realization** about *all* light‑crystal suffering.

**Complications**  
- **Security posture** at the Lighthouse is **hair‑trigger**; rune **use is logged**; **constructs** escalate quickly when provoked.  
- **Public heat** rising after the gate incident; **Badwater Well** rendezvous set in **one day**; Ellara sidelined for **two**.

**Open Questions**  
1) What leverage—if any—does **Eduard** have over **Reeves**?  
2) Can **Reeves** be tailed at the **Ducal Palace** without catastrophic risk?  
3) Does Ellara confront **Eduard** about the **screaming lamp** truth—and the **theology** it implies?  
4) How to re‑enter the Lighthouse without tripping **alarms**? (Stolen **guard** vs **artificer** passes now carry risk.)

**Next Session Hooks**  
- **Badwater Well meet‑up**.  
- **Reeves** itinerary intel via palace servants or vintners’ guild contacts.  
- **Non‑lethal kits** & cleaner **exfil** plans (mirror image & illusions worked; bolster with smoke/grease/cover stories).  
- **Ellara ↔ Berridin**: truth‑telling and trust, or the party’s **ethics line** snaps.

**Body Count (Bastion’s Ledger):** *None* this session.  
**Moral Equilibrium:** strained but intact.  
**Operational Assets:** existing rune passes; sending stones; field‑tested illusions and escapes; growing political picture.
