## 1) Rendezvous at Badwater Well

The party reconvened at **Badwater Well**, a dry landmark in East Bastion not far from where the group first met Ellara.

**Nyx** arrived concurrently with Ellara. Paranoia running high, he checked for tails but missed the mark (**Perception 7**), assuming he was safe despite a poor scan. **Ysidor** and **Berridin** arrived shortly after, followed by halfling children offering Berridin "not quite rotten" produce. Ysidor woke from a nap and ate an overripe fruit, disparaging the quality of city food.

**The Debrief & The Double-Check:**
> **Nyx:** "Were you followed?"
> **Ellara:** "Why do you keep asking that? Last we spoke you said nothing happened."
> **Nyx:** (Reluctantly) "...Things didn't go as well as we hoped."

Nyx offered a "broadstrokes" summary of the infiltration. Unconvinced by his own safety, he scanned the perimeter again, this time confirming with certainty that they were clear (**Perception 21**).

**Planning the Next Move:**
The group debated how to handle **Donnathan Reeves**.
* **Ysidor:** Proposed a direct approach: "We can take him, grab him and take care of him in an alley."
* **Ellara:** "What do you mean 'take care of him'?"
* **Berridin:** Suggested observing the **Ducal Palace** to see if automatons were present in a security role, which would link Reeves to the Duke.
* **Nyx (History Nat 20):** Recalled that the Duke operates through proxies. He advised against infiltrating the palace directly but agreed observing it was safer than doing nothing.

**The Split:**
* **Team Administration:** Nyx & Ysidor (in disguise) to the **Civic Hall of Records**.
* **Team Palace:** Ellara & Berridin to scout the **Ducal Palace** exterior.

## 2) Team Administration: Red Tape & The "Sickly Son"

Nyx and Ysidor crossed into the West side to find the housing registry.
* **Disguises:** Berridin applied makeup to Ysidor (**Deception 9**) to create **"Elk,"** a sickly, pallid, grey-skinned merchant's son. Nyx assumed the role of his father, **"Alexander"**.
* **The Approach:** Nyx moved like a shadow (**Stealth Nat 20 [27]**), while Ysidor lumbered conspicuously (**Stealth 3**).
* **The Strategy:** Realizing the contrast was dangerous, Nyx ordered: "If I walk with you, we're fucked. Walk ahead. Just be normal."
* **The Walk:** Crowds parted for Ysidor, assuming he was contagious. Ysidor (**Insight 9**) misinterpreted this fear as city-folk politeness.

**The Hall of Records:**
Nyx entered alone. Claiming to be a property manager for **Donnathan Reeves**, he requested housing records.
* **The Intel:** The clerk couldn't find "Reeves" but located **Viscount of Sommeil**.
    * **Address:** A large estate (3 stories, 2 cellars, balconies).
    * **Blueprint:** Request denied (requires signature).
    * **Nyx:** Copied the address details onto scrap paper.

## 3) The Accidental Abduction of Ysidor

While Nyx was inside, **Elk** was accosted by an elderly, well-dressed woman named **Lady Jacinta**.

> **Jacinta:** "Sir, are you alright? You look... not normal. Are you being abused?"
> **Elk:** "I usually look more grey than this... just taking in the fresh air."

Jacinta, mentioning she had an "open heart since her wife died," dragged him to her nearby estate for medical attention. Nyx emerged to find his partner missing, interrogated a bystander, and tracked them to a nearby manor.

**Inside Jacinta’s Manor:**
The Doctor attempted to examine Elk, who deflected with bizarre lies.
> **Elk:** "I should wait in case... the building falls."
> **Doctor:** "Did you eat something strange?"
> **Elk:** "An overripe apple."
> **Doctor:** "Constipation..."

**The "Father" Intervenes:**
Nyx knocked on the door as **Alexander**, the exasperated, negligent father.
> **Nyx:** "Oh goodness, Elk! I told you to wait outside. He keeps eating random things. He's not... the brightest."

Nyx successfully diffused the situation, agreeing with the "delusions" diagnosis, but Lady Jacinta insisted they stay for a lamb lunch.

## 4) Lunch with the Aristocracy: The "Open Secret"

Over lunch, Nyx and Ysidor milked Lady Jacinta for information while maintaining their cover (Nyx claiming to deal in raw materials and "select finished pieces").

**The Intel on Donnathan Reeves:**
* **The Connection:** Jacinta was friends with Reeves' mother and her late wife, Valinda, knew the social circles well.
* **The Scandal:** It is an "open secret" that Reeves and **Grand Duke Oliander** have been lovers since **Torchlight College**.
* **Reeves' Habits:** He stays at the **Ducal Palace**, not his own estate.
* **The Lamp:** Jacinta showed off a **Tiffany-style light crystal lamp**—artisanal work bought from Reeves.

**The Golden Dove Trap:**
Needing a cover address to receive an introduction to Reeves, Nyx panic-lied.
* **Lie:** "I'm staying at **The Golden Dove**."
* **Jacinta:** Impressed ("Quite, quite"). She promised to leave a message there.

## 5) Team Palace: Doctrine & Debauchery

Meanwhile, **Ellara** and **Berridin** (disguised as Eulogian acolytes via **Deception 18**) scouted the road to the Palace.

**The Palace Exterior:**
They observed carriages delivering goods. **Ellara (Perception 15)** noted names on carriages, while **Berridin (Perception Nat 20)** spotted a high-end tavern nearby. At the gates, they saw deactivated warforged.

* **Ellara (Religion 14):** Recalled the Eulogian schism regarding warforged. While many viewed them as an affront ("machines that walk as people"), **Proctor Eduard** had argued that "the eternal light gives us these gifts and the light shines through them," legitimizing their use.

**The Golden Dove:**
Berridin pushed them to enter the tavern he spotted.
* **The Drink:** They ordered "Java." Berridin spiked his; Ellara drank hers straight but became tipsy regardless.
* **The Intel:** Berridin (**Perception 17**) overheard rumors of a **Ball** being thrown by the Grand Duke for his "returned friend".
* **The Harassment:** Berridin tried to charm a waiter ("Your pretty face is wasted in this tavern"), who was a pious Eulogian and deeply offended.
* **The Argument:** Berridin defended his actions: "I have seen some horny old men that are Eulogia." Ellara retorted: "You will not be going as a Eulogian."

**Ellara’s Diplomacy:**
Ellara apologized for Berridin ("He does not represent the light") and approached a table of **Ducal Guards**.
* **Guard Diane:** Ellara used proper rites (**Insight 22**). Diane confirmed that **Proctor Eduard** usually attends these functions.
* **Exit:** Diane warned Ellara about her companion. Ellara angrily slapped 2 gold on the table and dragged Berridin out.

## 6) Regroup and Next Steps

The teams reconvened at Nyx's townhouse.

**The Debrief:**
* **Nyx:** "You wanted the lamb didn't you?"
* **Ysidor:** "It was good lamb. No one died."
* **Summary:** They confirmed Reeves' address, his relationship with the Duke, and the upcoming Ball.

**The Complication:**
Nyx realized he told Lady Jacinta he was staying at **The Golden Dove**. To maintain the cover, he needed to book a room immediately.

> **Nyx:** "I'll be back soon. Help yourselves to the food. Berridin, if you take anything, I'll kill you."

**The Departure:**
Ellara decided to leave for her dorms, walking part of the way with Nyx.
* **Ellara (Perception 10) / Nyx (Perception 7):** Neither noticed anything unusual on the walk.

**Session End State:**
* **Objective:** Access the **Ball** or use the **Jacinta** connection to get close to Reeves.
* **Cover Identities:** "Alexander" and "Elk" established with noble contact.
* **Financials:** Berridin is down 2 gold; Nyx is about to spend significantly on a luxury room.
