The first session established the setting in Bastion City, Hieroterra, a province with a notable "shadowed" population and less Eulogia influence. The city is split by a canal, with the West being affluent and the East, home to the Duskbreaker Lighthouse and light crystal research, being more utilitarian and leading to untamed lands.

Character activities included Berridin and Ysidor navigating the halfling quarter with some comedic interactions. Ellara sought information from a Denmother about a missing goliath, who suggested checking the eastern prisons, and later wrote a letter home. Nyx and Tsi'nyra focused on discretion, with Tsi'nyra exploring new surroundings. Nyx independently investigated missing persons in a shady tavern, learning from a guard about a goliath who was moved from an eastern to a western prison after a violent incident.
